It's World War II and Britain's Royal Air Force is up to its neck in Axis attacks. As one of the RAF's most aggressive pilots, you're in on flying the most crucial missions to stall the enemy.

They attack by land, air, and sea. Your only allies are your DeHavilland Mosquito, your weapons, and your wits. Chase the Nazi bombers, sink the U-boats before they can dive, outrun the V-1 buzz bombs, and stop the POW trains from reaching the enemy lines.

Choose your ammunition and fuel wisely -- once you're on a mission, there's no turning back. To be an Ace, you need four enemy defeats. To be Ace of Aces, you've got to be the best!</desc>

		<name>Ballblazer</name>
		<desc>Ballblazer is a simple one-on-one sports-style game bearing similarities to basketball and soccer. Each side is represented by a craft called a "rotofoil", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled "droid" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.</desc>

Grandpa has given you an Atari light gun to help protect the farm. The moving targets are a challenge. Can you hit them? If not, try the veggies! They're fun to shoot at.

In the barnyard, bottles and cans on the fence provide great practive for warming up the old shootin' iron. But perfect aim alone isn't enough. You'll need speed, too.
In the cornfield, birds swoop from the sky and rabbits scamper among the stalks, Owls and other pests appear inside a barn. Each scene can only be reached by hitting enough targest in the scene before. Once you zero in on some fancy shooting scores, Gramps offers you a bonus round by tossing target bottles in the air.</desc>

		<desc>You and Grandpa are down on the farm. There are critters, bottles, and varmints everywhere -- in the barn, in the yard, and in the cornfield. Grandpa has given you an Atari light gun to help protect the farm. The moving targets are a challenge. Can you hit them? If not, try the veggies! They're fun to shoot at.

In the barnyard, bottles and cans on the fence provide great practive for warming up the old shootin' iron. But perfect aim alone isn't enough. You'll need speed, too.
In the cornfield, birds swoop from the sky and rabbits scamper among the stalks, Owls and other pests appear inside a barn. Each scene can only be reached by hitting enough targest in the scene before. Once you zero in on some fancy shooting scores, Gramps offers you a bonus round by tossing target bottles in the air.</desc>

		<desc>Vinne and Slash are bleeding from knife wounds and the ref is out cold! No wonder the gang members nicknamed this game "Basketbrawl." To them, it's not a game -- it's a street fight. This premise kicks off Atari's action sports game for up to two players. The objective in Basketbrawl is to become the baddest gang in the town by winning the Basketbrawl tournament. To win, you must play three games against each of the five gangs in your city. Each time you move up to the next gang, you will play a team with more players and more dangerous weapons. Each game lasts six minutes -- out score you opponent by shooting more baskets. Each basket is worth two points. If the game is tied after six minutes, the first team to score wins</desc>

As the crack shot COMMANDO, you have been given the ultimate. mission. You alone must battle overwhelming odds to defend the free world from being taken over by advancing rebel forces.

To make matters worse, much of the Allies heavy artillery has already been destroyed.You must carry out your solo or crusade through hostile territory armed with only a rifle, hand grenades, and raw courage.

The odds for success seem hopelessly slim as enemy fire flies toward you from all directions and hidden rebel forces appear from caves, trenches, and strongholds to bar your progress. But the Allies are depending on your famous ingenuity, accuracy, and speed to help you break through the enemy lines. You must reach the fortress while collecting supplies from defeated outposts along the way.

		<desc>Over scorching deserts, through dark icy caverns, around a fiery volcano, and under the leafy cover of a steamy jungle, you set out with three brave friends to retrieve the treasures stolen by the Evil Master.  Your goal is his castle far, far, away.

Your friends are lightly armed, but you carry your trusty crossbow.  By shooting its swift arrows, you can save yourself and your companions from the dangerous attacks of the Evil Master's creatures -- scorpions, ants, pterodactyls, voracious plants, bats, snakes, and other horrible beings.

When you reach the castle, the Evil Master's expert archers await you, ready to test their aim with deadly arrows.  Inside the castle, a fierce dragon also waits, guarding the treasure with its fiery breath.

Few adventurers have dared to make the trek.  No one yet has come back alive.</desc>

		<desc>Donkey Kong the ape is back. Only this time the vengeful Mario is holding the ape prisoner. Luckily the ape has a son, Donkey Kong Junior, who will try to rescue Papa.

To free his dad, Junior must make his way through a dark and treacherous jungle. Racing against time, the little fellow climbs and swings across vines, while avoiding the terrible Snapjaws.

If he reaches the keys to Papa's cage, Junior must push them to the top of chains while staying clear of Snapjaws and a new flock of nasty Nitpickers. But even then his mission isn't over. Once he reaches Mario's hideout, he must pass yet another test against time.

The kid needs help. Don't just stand there! Help poor Junior save his father!</desc>

		<desc>Twin brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee learned to fight the hard way -- for survival in the unforgiving city streets. Their brand of combat -- classic martial arts maneuvers mixed with anything-goes street brawling -- has turned them into walking lethal weapons.

Now, the Lees must summon all their fighting abilities and cunning into meeting the greatest challenge of their lives -- rescuing Billy's girlfriend, Marion.  She's been kidnapped by the Black Warriors, the savage street gang led by the mysterious Shadow Boss.

The twins pursue the Black Warriors through the city streets and its outskirts.  Finally they fight their way into the Secret Enemy Base.  There, Billy and Jimmy meet the Shadow Boss.  It's a battle to the finish, with Marion as the prize!</desc>

You must leave the protective fortress Albagon and deliver the newly developed radiation vaccine to the few survivors. Your journey will not be an easy one. Nefarious henchmen are waiting to knock you off and steal the vaccine to ensure that they will survive to rule the planet. Every driver on the road is out to get you. Your only hope is to get them first.

You must find the rocket poised to launch a satellite that can nullify the effects of this cosmic accident that turned the world upside down. If you're sharp enough to learn and remember the secret code words and tough enough to live to use them, you can launch the rocket and save the world!

		<desc>The year is 2089. A collision with a comet has left the earth reeling from radiation poisoning. There's little hope for humanity's survival. It's up to you to help the few people remaining.

You must leave the protective fortress Albagon and deliver the newly developed radiation vaccine to the few survivors. Your journey will not be an easy one. Nefarious henchmen are waiting to knock you off and steal the vaccine to ensure that they will survive to rule the planet. Every driver on the road is out to get you. Your only hope is to get them first.

You must find the rocket poised to launch a satellite that can nullify the effects of this cosmic accident that turned the world upside down. If you're sharp enough to learn and remember the secret code words and tough enough to live to use them, you can launch the rocket and save the world!

Good luck! Humanity is in your hands.</desc>

		<desc>What a night for a hockey game! After weeks of intensive training on the ice, you're finally at the face-off, waiting for the starting whistle. As the puck slides across the smooth, icy surface, you take it at center ice, managing to break over the blue line to your opponent's right. Whoooossh. What reflexes! What speed!

The spray of the ice on your face momentarily blinds you, but you continue to skate furiously, weaving towards the opposing goal. You can feel your challenger's hot breath on the back of your neck, as the distance between you grows smaller and smaller. But before he can manage to steal the puck, you swing your stick and whack -- it's a slapshot! The point is yours!

Get three goals in a game, and it's a hat trick!</desc>

		<desc>You are a member of those elite combat specialists, the Ikari Warriors.  Your buddy and you are on a special mission behind enemy lines, and you've been sleeping, eating, and breathing jungle combat for the last two weeks.  You're tired, but that never affects your razor-sharp judgment and your will to survive.  

Your main weapons are machine guns, grenades, and your own cunning in the face of danger.  Sometimes you'll have a tank at your disposal, which comes in handy when enemy fire is particularly brutal.  

You move swiftly through the jungle, wading through rivers and resting from time to time within the ruins of bombed-out buildings.  You're running out of ammunition and grenades, but you know the battle can't last forever.  Sooner or later, one side is going to emerge victorious.  Let's just hope it's yours!</desc>

Your main weapons are machine guns, grenades, and your own cunning in the face of danger.  Sometimes you'll have a tank at your disposal, which comes in handy when enemy fire is particularly brutal.  

You move swiftly through the jungle, wading through rivers and resting from time to time within the ruins of bombed-out buildings.  You're running out of ammunition and grenades, but you know the battle can't last forever.  Sooner or later, one side is going to emerge victorious.  Let's just hope it's yours!</desc>

An enigma for centuries, JINKS is a lush, resource-rich world, and could be the key to the desperate need for human expansion in space. It is apparently capable of supporting life, yet it is curiously uninhabited--or is it?
 A routine research mission goes haywire when scouting your probe across the planet's surface leads you and your crew into a deadly game of cat and mouse. Can you escape from these fiendishly clever traps before your probe and its occupants are miniaturized or annihilated?</desc>

Your grief and rage turn to cold determination. You vow never again to submit to the evil warlord. You know you must avenge your village and rescue your beloved Princess Mariko from Akuma’s mountain fortress.

Alone, armed only with your knowledge of Karate, you must outfight Akuma’s vicious warriors, each one more powerful than the last. Fight on, deep into the heart of the palace, where to rescue Mariko you must confront the cruel Akuma himself in hand-to-hand combat.

Put fear and self-concern behind you. Focus your will on your objective, accepting death as a possibility, and do what you have chosen to do. This is the Way of the Karateka.</desc>

		<desc>Returning home after years of study under a Master of Karate, you find your village burned to the ground. Your friends and family are scattered, your bride-to-be stolen by Akuma, the warlord whose oppressive shadow has darkened your village since before you were born.

Your grief and rage turn to cold determination. You vow never again to submit to the evil warlord. You know you must avenge your village and rescue your beloved Princess Mariko from Akuma’s mountain fortress.

Alone, armed only with your knowledge of Karate, you must outfight Akuma’s vicious warriors, each one more powerful than the last. Fight on, deep into the heart of the palace, where to rescue Mariko you must confront the cruel Akuma himself in hand-to-hand combat.

Put fear and self-concern behind you. Focus your will on your objective, accepting death as a possibility, and do what you have chosen to do. This is the Way of the Karateka.</desc>

		<desc>Wouldn't you know it, you drew Bruno the Sledge, five time champion and all-around bad guy, as your first opponent in your quest for that elusive Atari Wrestling Federation championship belt. Ever since he lost his title to Eric the Flaxen Saxon, Bruno's been terrorizing the AWF circuit.

Bruno the Sledge glares at you with his one remaining eye. When the bell rings, he charges like a man insane. Just before the impact of his 386-pound body, you step aside and raise your elbow.

Perfect elbow smash! Bruno falls to the mat. You get him in a head lock, but his shaved head slips free. Then you see it. The famous Bruno the Sledge "Eye of Terror," the look of death. You're in trouble now!

Mat Mania Challenge provides all the thrills and spills of professional wrestling. Do you have what it takes to survive brain busters and pile drivers? If you have the skills, the championship belt will be yours!</desc>

They have sabotaged a number of nuclear reactors by unleashing a deadly string of ‘sparkx’ that will break down the protective control rods and make their way into the very core of each reactor.

		<desc>Don’t panic! A gang of international terrorists has systematically set about destroying the world. They have sabotaged a number of nuclear reactors by unleashing a deadly string of ‘sparkx’ that will break down the protective control rods and make their way into the very core of each reactor. If the sparkx reach the core, the end result will be a dreaded meltdown. It the terrorists are successful in their hideous plot, we can kiss this world goodbye!

Only you stand between life as we know it and total annihilation. You are armed with a specially engineered sparkx-destroying gun, a blueprint of each reactor, your wits, and your desire to save the world. Get moving. There’s no time to lose!</desc>

		<desc>You finished it at last!  And now you are going crazy waiting to test your sleek, hot, fast customized bike.  It absorbs your every waking moment, you dream about it every night.  It has become an obsession.  And you know just the place to try it out.

The annual MotorPsycho Competition (for deranged, psychopathic, and other unusual biker types) is this weekend!  Its obstacle-laden course is legendary among motorcycle maniacs.  Of course, nobody in their right mind would attempt this course.  The die-hard spectators remind you that fan is short for fanatic. They've staked out their favorite spots to view the races, and they are waiting for the roar of revving engines, the squeal of tires, the crunch of metal...

It's you against the clock and your bike is built for speed.  All you need to do is point it in the right direction and go for it!

Four different tracks will separate the veterans from the rookies.  (Or the schizophrenics from the psychotics.)  Weekend amateurs will eat your dust, but you've got some pretty insane competition from your fellow, uh, pros.  Some of these guys look hungry for the sweet taste of victory, but some of them look hungry for the taste of raw meat!

So rev 'er up and let 'er rip!  The winner's circle (or the guy with the clean white coat) awaits.</desc>

		<desc>For ten years you've trained to be a Ninja. And now your Master tells you that it's time to take the final, most difficult test and become a Master Ninja. You must complete the game of death. You must play nine holes of... Ninja Golf?

You knew your Master was a bit weird, but nothing prepared you for this! You must attempt to sneak in a birdie between karate kicks while you battle Ninja opponents. Par for this course means leaving the green littered with fallen foes.

You gain points for both your golf game and defeating attacking Ninja. You can also earn points for finding treasures and other bonus items along the course.

Once you've completed all nine holes successfully, be ready to challenge the disguised Master Ninja. This final battle will determine whether or not you become a Master Ninja. And if you win, it will improve your golf score.</desc>

		<desc>For ten years you've trained to be a Ninja. And now your Master tells you that it's time to take the final, most difficult test and become a Master Ninja. You must complete the game of death. You must play nine holes of... Ninja Golf?

You knew your Master was a bit weird, but nothing prepared you for this! You must attempt to sneak in a birdie between karate kicks while you battle Ninja opponents. Par for this course means leaving the green littered with fallen foes.

You gain points for both your golf game and defeating attacking Ninja. You can also earn points for finding treasures and other bonus items along the course.

Once you've completed all nine holes successfully, be ready to challenge the disguised Master Ninja. This final battle will determine whether or not you become a Master Ninja. And if you win, it will improve your golf score.</desc>

		<desc>You're out on a dream court for a hot game of One-on-One. You're the Bird. Or you're Dr. J. And that's the last decision you'll have much time to make. You can play against the computer of challenge a friend. Your capabilities -- and your opponent's -- will be just like those of All-Stars Larry Bird and Julius (Dr. J) Erving. The computer knows their shooting percentages (guarded and unguarded) and their pet shots. Your scoring ability will depend on your timing, how effectively you're being guarded, and where you're shooting from. Like the game of basketball itself, One-on-One rewards you for playing with your head as well as your hands. Master the joystick moves, sharpen your timing, hone your reflexes until you can handle the Pro level... and don't let the other guy out-think you.</desc>

		<desc>It's the last game of the World Series. You're in the 9th innings. Bases loaded. One out. And your up to bat.

What do you do? Swing away? Wait for a walk? Go for the fences? It's all up to you, just like in real pro ball.

Sure, we'll give you the options. And some tips. Like in pitching. Batting. And Fielding. But, it's you call .

There are 6 full-color, live action screens - just like the ones you see on TV! The pitching/battting screen, left infield, right infield, leftfield, centerfield and rightfield.

So, start warming up. Step up to the plate. And take your best swing at winning
the series!

Your spaceship, which oddly looks like an airplane, has the grave task of defending Earth from an alien armada. Planet Smashers has some nice features like level warp codes, laser upgrades, cloaking devices, and interesting bosses. You even have the burden of defending Earth's shield from asteroids and alien ships. The back of the box boasts, "awesome sound effects", but the main laser noise is mind-numbingly irritating.

		<desc>Planet Smashers finally delivered an original 2D Shooter to the Pro System late in its life. Your spaceship, which oddly looks like an airplane, has the grave task of defending Earth from an alien armada. Planet Smashers has some nice features like level warp codes, laser upgrades, cloaking devices, and interesting bosses. You even have the burden of defending Earth's shield from asteroids and alien ships. The back of the box boasts, "awesome sound effects", but the main laser noise is mind-numbingly irritating. After you defeat the game, you are treated to a text ending commanding you to play Alien Brigade, which makes little sense since you just defeated the alien mothership.</desc>

		<name>Pole Position II</name>
		<desc>Are you good enough to race with the best? Do you have the nerve and skill to be a professional race car driver? You are about to find out! Behind the wheel of your sleek Formula I race car you will pit yourself against the clock and the world's top racers to win the Pole Position II, the number one starting spot.

To enter the Grand Prix itself, you'll have to race at hair-raising speeds to complete the Qualifying Lap in 73 seconds or less. Then choose from four courses, ranging from the relatively innocuous Test course to the perilous Suzuka track.

Test your racing skills as you tear around treacherous curves, maneuver your way out of dangerous skids, and veer around hazardous obstacles. Go flat out to beat the track record and you'll be the Grand Prix winner!</desc>

		<name>Sentinel</name>
		<desc>You're a scientist, and your invention, a pulsating, glowing orb called the Sentinel, absorbs and stores energy from a variety of sources. Now Earth is threatened by deadly aliens and you must use your creation to save the planet. The Sentinel absorbs energy from every power pod or energy capsule you shoot with your Atari light gun. When an energy source is hit, a beam blasts out from the Sentinel, strikes the target with hissing force, and draws energy back into your Sentinel. It's up to you to protect the Sentinel as it glides over the planets.

This was the only game for the 7800 that was originally released in PAL format only. Thanks to ResQsoft, an NTSC version is also available for gamers in the Western Hemisphere. Sentinel is a light gun game that is similar to Crossbow in the aspect that you are in charge of protecting your ally, in this case the Sentinel, from attack. The game features four stages, each which its own name and level boss. What makes the game unique is that shooting the large orange Sentinel acts as a smart bomb, destroying everything on the screen. While Sentinel is a very hard title to find in the wild in the Americas, this game is pretty common in Europe and can normally be purchased through online auctions at a reasonable price.</desc>

		<name>Tank Command</name>
		<desc>Tank Command is a vertically scrolling action game. You control a tank on a mission to capture the enemy flag as well as earn as many points as possible. To do this, you will need to blast your way through their defenses on three levels of increasing difficulty. Blocking your progress are enemy tanks, pillboxes, missiles, jeeps, infantry, huts, and more, all of which earn you points when destroyed. Your tank is equipped with a limited amount of fuel and ammo, however it can be replenished occasionally by collecting the bonus icons when they appear on the screen. If you can make it past all of the obstacles and capture the flag, then you win the game!

The 7800 is pretty much void of super-rare games like the 2600'?s Tooth Protectors and Chase the Chuckwagon, but don't worry, tracking down Tank Command in a box will cost you a pretty penny. As far as gameplay goes, Tank Command is not going to blow anyone away. Here you have a vertical scroller like Commando or Ikari Warriors minus the charm, quality level design, and reasonable difficulty. There are only three levels in the game, but just like its Froggo cousin Water Ski, the difficulty ramps so severely after the mindless first level that continuing takes strong will. The pink terrain is a bit odd, as well. Tank Command was only released in NTSC format.</desc>

Your tank is equipped with a limited amount of fuel and ammo, however it can be replenished occasionally by collecting the bonus icons when they appear on the screen. If you can make it past all of the obstacles and capture the flag, then you win the game!

The 7800 is pretty much void of super-rare games like the 2600'?s Tooth Protectors and Chase the Chuckwagon, but don't worry, tracking down Tank Command in a box will cost you a pretty penny. As far as gameplay goes, Tank Command is not going to blow anyone away. Here you have a vertical scroller like Commando or Ikari Warriors minus the charm, quality level design, and reasonable difficulty. There are only three levels in the game, but just like its Froggo cousin Water Ski, the difficulty ramps so severely after the mindless first level that continuing takes strong will. The pink terrain is a bit odd, as well. Tank Command was only released in NTSC format.</desc>

		<desc>A serious problem is blocking attempts to colonize the otherwise life-compatible planet Nebulus: it's water is poisonous! The only way to return the water to its harmless, natural form is to destroy the eight enormous towers that maintain a mysterious, lethal hold over all forms of this valuable resource.

Spurred to action by the needs of your dangerously overpopulated home planet, you must attempt to conquer these alien-forsaken relics once and for all. But it won't be easy! You'll have to climb each tower all the way to the top in order to detonate its vulnerable spot. And, succeeding towers are more difficult to topple!

You'll need all your wits about you to avoid huge, crushing boulders, giant eyes, and indestructible mutant molecules! And watch out for those slippery stairs and disintegrating ledges. One false step and you'll plummet to the depths below!</desc>

		<desc>A serious problem is blocking attempts to colonize the otherwise life-compatible planet Nebulus: it's water is poisonous! The only way to return the water to its harmless, natural form is to destroy the eight enormous towers that maintain a mysterious, lethal hold over all forms of this valuable resource.

Spurred to action by the needs of your dangerously overpopulated home planet, you must attempt to conquer these alien-forsaken relics once and for all. But it won't be easy! You'll have to climb each tower all the way to the top in order to detonate its vulnerable spot. And, succeeding towers are more difficult to topple!

You'll need all your wits about you to avoid huge, crushing boulders, giant eyes, and indestructible mutant molecules! And watch out for those slippery stairs and disintegrating ledges. One false step and you'll plummet to the depths below!</desc>

		<desc>In Water Ski you are water skiing on the Pharonna River. You control both the boat and skier in this vertically scrolling action game. Your goal is to reach the finish line before time runs out and also to earn as many points as possible. The river is quite dangerous, and features many twists and turns along with rocks, logs and other obstacles. For bonus points there are numerous ramps located throughout the river which your skier can jump over (and if you can manage to ski over every ramp on the level, you'll earn even more points!). You start the game with four skiers, and the game ends when all of you skiers have crashed.</desc>

		<desc>Hostile aliens - Xenophobes - are infesting space stations vital to your planet's security.  These aliens threaten to overrun the stations, rendering the space stations useless.

You are part of an elite team who is ready to speed to these endangered space stations.  Your mission is clear: destroy the aliens, regain control of the space stations, and pick up any valuable hardware you might discover as you sweep the stations for aliens.

The aliens are a swarming band of uglies, straight out of your worst nightmare. You'll need to use your talent just to stay alive as you rid each space station of these pests.  You don't want to let them catch you.  It's them or you.

The message has come.  It's up to you and your teammates to cleanse each space station of aliens.  Your Mother Ship brings you to the vicinity of each overrun space station.  You then enter the space station via a transfer disk.

Team up with another member of your elite squad, or work on your own to clear the aliens from an infested space station.  Just be careful as you enter a space station.  The aliens are everywhere!</desc>

Now the Xevions want Earth back -- minus humans! Their invasion forces are fierce -- the land is crawling with deadly Domogram Rovers; the sky is black with Toroid Patrol Fleets and Zoshi Death Squads.

Our puny weapons offer no defense. Earth's only hope is our powerful new Solvalou Fighter Plane. Its pilot will have a single mission: Penetrate the enemy ranks and destroy the Xevious Mother Ship.

The mission is dangerous. We can't guarantee success. But at this point, it's do or die!

One small problem. We still need a pilot. Any volunteers?</desc>

Now the Xevions want Earth back -- minus humans! Their invasion forces are fierce -- the land is crawling with deadly Domogram Rovers; the sky is black with Toroid Patrol Fleets and Zoshi Death Squads.

Our puny weapons offer no defense. Earth's only hope is our powerful new Solvalou Fighter Plane. Its pilot will have a single mission: Penetrate the enemy ranks and destroy the Xevious Mother Ship.

The mission is dangerous. We can't guarantee success. But at this point, it's do or die!

One small problem. We still need a pilot. Any volunteers?</desc>

		<desc>Over scorching deserts, through dark icy caverns, around a fiery volcano, and under the leafy cover of a steamy jungle, you set out with three brave friends to retrieve the treasures stolen by the Evil Master.  Your goal is his castle far, far, away.

Your friends are lightly armed, but you carry your trusty crossbow.  By shooting its swift arrows, you can save yourself and your companions from the dangerous attacks of the Evil Master's creatures -- scorpions, ants, pterodactyls, voracious plants, bats, snakes, and other horrible beings.

When you reach the castle, the Evil Master's expert archers await you, ready to test their aim with deadly arrows.  Inside the castle, a fierce dragon also waits, guarding the treasure with its fiery breath.

Few adventurers have dared to make the trek.  No one yet has come back alive.</desc>

		<desc>Donkey Kong the ape is back. Only this time the vengeful Mario is holding the ape prisoner. Luckily the ape has a son, Donkey Kong Junior, who will try to rescue Papa.

To free his dad, Junior must make his way through a dark and treacherous jungle. Racing against time, the little fellow climbs and swings across vines, while avoiding the terrible Snapjaws.

If he reaches the keys to Papa's cage, Junior must push them to the top of chains while staying clear of Snapjaws and a new flock of nasty Nitpickers. But even then his mission isn't over. Once he reaches Mario's hideout, he must pass yet another test against time.

The kid needs help. Don't just stand there! Help poor Junior save his father!</desc>

		<desc>Trump That Ace!

It's World War II and Britain's Royal Air Force is up to its neck in Axis attacks. As one of the RAF's most aggressive pilots, you're in on flying the most crucial missions to stall the enemy.

They attack by land, air, and sea. Your only allies are your DeHavilland Mosquito, your weapons, and your wits. Chase the Nazi bombers, sink the U-boats before they can dive, outrun the V-1 buzz bombs, and stop the POW trains from reaching the enemy lines.

Choose your ammunition and fuel wisely -- once you're on a mission, there's no turning back. To be an Ace, you need four enemy defeats. To be Ace of Aces, you've got to be the best!</desc>
