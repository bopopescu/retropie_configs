		<desc>In Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere the player takes the place of an ace fighter pilot who works for an organization called "UPEO" and has to accomplish various missions, e.g. taking out a special aircraft carrier or taking out enemy satellite systems in orbit around earth. The player can earn ratings from A to D: the higher the rating, the higher the chance that the player can acquire new kinds of planes. The game has many environments which range from normal aerial missions to stratospheric missions and even outer space missions. A special catch is that the player often has to make decisions during missions which influence the overall storyline. There is also an autopilot feature which can be used to land or reach a destination.</desc>

		<name>The Adventures of Lomax</name>
		<desc>Lomax's friends are in trouble, and it's up to you to save them from the sinister villain, Evil Ed. Using a magical spell, the fiend has kidnapped them and is forcing them to do whatever he instructs. Adventures of Lomax is a platform game that presents itself as a Lemmings spin-off (after all, it is developed by the same company).

As the hero, you will have to jump and shoot your way through a multitude of side scrolling 2D levels while picking up different power-ups. The special items Lomax encounters gain him invincibility; increase the jumping range and power of his attacks. Most effects fade off in a specific amount of time and are there to give you a quick health boost.

Adventures of Lomax takes place across several stages (over 40 in all) that range from outdoor areas, caves, and dark and spooky castles (four different environments). Because this is a platformer, you'll run across obstacles from time to time, required to either blast things away, like bats and zombies, or jump from platform to platform.</desc>

		<path>./Alien Resurrection (USA).PBP</path>
		<name>Alien Resurrection</name>
		<desc>Two hundred years after the events of Alien³, Lieutenant Ellen Ripley is cloned by military scientists interested in the Alien Queen she had become a host for. Like the "Company" from the earlier films, the military intends to use the Queen to breed a force of bio-weapons. But then something goes wrong; the Aliens they are studying manage to escape, and swarm throughout the science ship. It's up to four stranded heroes - Ripley, Call, DiStephano and Christie - to wipe out the Aliens, and return the ship safely to Earth.

Gameplay is standard FPS action, with limited ammo and plenty of hazards to detour around or find the switch to deactivate. The player switches between the four main characters at each level change, each with a slightly different set of abilities (Call has a motion tracker, Christie has his twin pistols from the film). Levels are based around keeping the Auriga running, and making their way through the ship to escape.</desc>

		<path>./Alien Trilogy (USA).PBP</path>
		<name>Alien Trilogy</name>
		<desc>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.

Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.

Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</desc>

The ship on which Alundra is coming to the village goes down, but Alundra himself is washed up on a beach near the village. There, a blacksmith Jess takes care of him and treats him like his own son. But Alundra, stepping into the dreams of the village people, understands there's a danger somewhere. The people have horrible nightmares, and only Alundra can find out what they mean...

Alundra is an action role playing game (RPG) somewhat similar to the famous Zelda games. It uses real-time combat and has a lot of physical and environmental puzzles. A big part of the game is spent in dungeons, where the player has to solve puzzles in order to proceed.</desc>

		<path>./Arc the Lad Collection - Arc the Lad (USA).PBP</path>
		<name>Arc the Lad [USA]</name>
		<desc>A girl named Kukuru lives in a village controlled by the Sacred Tribe - people who guard an ancient flame which contains a powerful spirit that was sealed in it many years ago. Kukuru must marry a man she doesn't love, and in order to avoid this marriage, she accepts the offer of the mayor: he asks her to extinguish the flame. As a result, the spirit awakes and threatens to destroy the world. A young adventurer named Arc arrives to the village at the same moment as Kukuru is standing frightened in front of the spirit. Arc immediately recognizes it - it was the murderer of his father! Before he realizes how that could be possible, the spirit disappears, and now Arc and Kukuru have to do everything in their powers to undo the error, to stop the spirit, and perhaps to avenge the death of Arc's father.

"Arc the Lad" is a hybrid of traditional and strategy-based console-style RPGs. The story unfolds as you are transported from location to location and enter battles - you don't walk around on the world map, choosing yourself which location to visit. The battles take place on a battle field, on which you can move and attack only when you approach the opponent.</desc>

		<name>Arc the Lad II [USA]</name>
		<desc>This direct sequel to "Arc the Lad" continues the unfinished story of the first game, but starts from a totally different perspective. You control a bounty-hunter named Elk, who suffers from amnesia. On his quest for his own true identity he discovers the powers hidden within him, and the destiny of his entire tribe. While pursuing his archenemy, Elk meets up with Arc, the hero of the first game, and then both realize they have been looking to destroy the very same evil.

The battle system of "Arc the Lad II" is similar to the one used in its predecessor: in battles you can move your characters on the battle field, and your proximity to the enemies plays an important role. You cause and take different amounts of damage depending on your position on the battle field. Unlike the first game, this one is a full-fledged adventure/RPG, without the "strategy" feel of the predecessor. You move through the game world on your own, visiting towns and exploring dungeons.</desc>

		<name>Arc the Lad III [USA]</name>
		<desc>The events of this game take place several years after Elk and Arc faced their ultimate enemy in "Arc the Lad II". You control Alec, a teenager whose entire village was destroyed by an unknown evil - an event that was later called "The Great Disaster". He was saved by a mysterious Hunter. Since then, growing peacefully in a village he was brought to, which was like a new home for the survivors of the Great Disaster, Alec dreams about meeting the Hunter again, and becoming a Hunter himself. Together with his best friend Lutz he tries his luck in nearby towns, receiving small Hunter jobs, until the fate crosses the ways of the two young people with a mysterious organization called the Academy. And there their adventure really begins...

The gameplay of this third installment of Arc the Lad series is very similar to that of the predecessor. You fight enemies in turn-based battles, and can move freely on the battlefield, positioning your party members the way you like. You can upgrade your weapons by forging them with special materials, and have a variety of techniques and magic spells at your disposal.</desc>

Because of the amount, the mission will obviously be intensely dangerous, but Ravens aren't the type to shy away from any challenge.

Multi-national companies are lined up at your door, paying you to complete certain objectives, which mainly include the destruction of a certain target or another mech. The more you complete, the better the pay and job offers, therefore allowing you to build the ultimate Armored Core.

		<name>Battle Arena Toshinden</name>
		<desc>In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3d movement, Toshinden's game play can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves.

Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls.

The U.S and E.U Playstation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using different instruments. 

The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature. 

Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.

The later Dos version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese Playstation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on Playstation.</desc>

		<name>Battle Arena Toshinden 3 [USA]</name>
		<desc>The third instalment of the Toshinden series.

After the defeat of the Secret Society in Battle Arena Toshinden 2 a new group of bad guys emerges. Known as the Organization, they wish to use the Toshinden fighters as blood sacrifices for a ritual to summon their dark god.

The number of fighters has been raised from Toshinden 2's 15 characters to a notably larger 32; 14 starting fighters, 14 Organization counterparts and 4 bosses. Though many of the Organization counterparts have near identical move lists to their equivalent starting character.

Toshinden 3's game play is a radical departure from previous games in the series.

The arenas have been redesigned so that they are now enclosed allowing the ability to send the opponent flying into a wall or the ceiling, though the opponent can recover and use the wall for a counter attack.

The combo system has been redesigned again; now each character has a preset range of combo's, however multiple combo's and special moves can now be combined to juggle the opponent for multiple hits, though once again the opponent can recover and counter your combo.

The games physics have been greatly relaxed to accommodate the new arenas and game play; many attacks launch the opponent clean across the arena.

The U.S and E.U versions of Toshinden 3 feature a slightly different blocking set up to the Japanese version. In the Japanese version there are separate high and low blocks, whereas in the U.S and E.U version the high block has been altered to be an all purpose block and will block both high and low automatically.

		<name>The Hunter</name>
		<desc>Battle Hunter is an anime-styled tactical role-playing game, released for the PlayStation in 1999. The game revolves around a player-controlled hunter that must compete with three other hunters in order to win a relic, and makes heavy use of traditional RPG conventions such as dice and tile-based movement.

In the years after a major world war, the few scientists remaining on Earth set out to develop a formula to protect humanity from extinction. To be successful they require vital information from the ruins of cities around the world, and assign the task of collecting it to an elite task force known as the Hunters. The story revolves around the player getting jobs from the shop owner to recover relics of interest from dungeons. Eventually the player will compete against a secret organization known as B PHS for the target relics.</desc>

		<desc>Years ago, the Earth was threatened by an evil being known as the Plutonium Boss. The Plutonium Boss and his minions were devouring the Earth from within, and if they had succeeded, Earth would've been destroyed.

He didn't count on a young man named Jason, a beautiful alien woman named Eve, and their battle tank, the Sofia MA-01...because of his underestimation, the Plutonium Boss was defeated.

Since then, Jason had been defending the Earth from any threat that arises, with Eve by his side. She even bore him two children, Roddy and Elfie. Jason trained Elfie in engineering, and Roddy in battling in Sofia. But now Jason and Eve have died, and Roddy must take his father's place as defender of the Earth.

And an old threat seems to be arising to challenge this new generation of heroes...</desc>

Set free by the the workers of Dauna Mine, Ryu of the Brood learns to both understand his power, and to understand the history of his extinct kind. By both utilizing Ryu's unique power and the abilities of those whom assist him, players will uncover the history of the Brood, learn more about the characters, and the very reason why the Brood were wiped out.

Players control Ryu and his allies on their journey, each of Ryu's friends have abilities only they can use, and they will have to work together to make their way through the obstacles and enemies that they encounter; creativity is key to your success in this game!

Ryu eventually is able to utilize his power of the Brood, allowing him to ascend into various dragon-like forms. This is done using a gene-splicing system that dictates what sort of form Ryu will take.

Breath of Fire III also includes a Master System, which permits Ryu and his allies to learn from various people to augment their abilities differently as they gain experience; these trainers can also teach abilities to those whom train hard under them.</desc>

Flying through the sky on their sandflier, Nina and Cray are attacked by a worm shaped dragon. With their vehicle damaged, Nina returns to the city to find parts, bumping into a naked young boy named Ryu along the way, who is unsure of where he is. At the very same time, Nina is again attacked by a dragon. Confused by the strange events taking place, Nina agrees to help the young boy. Meanwhile, the ancient Emperor Fou Lu awakens from his slumber in his tomb. His plan is to return to the world of human, conquer it anew, and impose his iron rule on it...

This fourth installment of the  Breath of Fire series is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG, with turn-based combat, party management, linear story progression, and other characteristic elements of the genre. As in the  previous game, characters become stronger and learn new skills by performing tasks for "masters" living in different towns. Ryu, the main protagonist of the series, has retained the series' trademark gameplay element: the ability to turn into a dragon during combat. Breath of Fire IV is rich in mini-games of various types, including the popular fishing mini-game that was present in previous installments as well.</desc>

		<name>Bushido Blade 2 [USA]</name>
		<desc>Two samurai families who date back over eight hundred years have been feuding ever since the Gempei War, where the Kagami family sided with the Minamoto and ensured themselves a victory over their rivals, the Sue. Over the centuries since, the two families evolved into ninja clans, but their hatred of each other never faded. Now, in the 20th century, the Shainto, descendants of the Sue, are in a position to bring vengeance on the Narukagami. 

Bushido Blade 2 takes place sometime after the events in the original game and is also a weapon fighting game without health bars, power displays, or over-the-top special maneuvers. The game features the Story Mode, Versus Mode and Slash mode present in the original game as well as a new tournament mode, where the two sides face each other with shinai and other bamboo weapons in a kendo like ring. Fighters have different styles (including some with two sword nito and iaijutsu styles) and there are many weapons to choose from (although the hammer has been replaced with the yari spear). The controls have changed somewhat, but stances are still in the game, as are one-hit kills if blows strike a sensitive part of the body.

Initially players can choose from six warriors, three from each clan. As progress is made in the story mode, supporting characters will be encountered. If beaten, those characters will become available for play in the game's other modes.</desc>

		<desc>Bubble Symphony (also known as Bubble Bobble 2) is an arcade video game in the Bubble Bobble series. While being a new Bubble Bobble for a new generation, in actuality it takes place after Parasol Stars. 

For this adventure, Bubblun and Bobblun, the typical green and blue dinosaurs, are joined by girls Kululun (an orange dragon) and Cororon (a magenta dragon). These are stated as the four children of the starring characters from Bubble Bobble. 

According to the intro, the four characters (as humans) are reading books when they inadvertently unleash Hyper Drunk, the final boss, from one of the books. He transforms the four into bubble dragons and banishes them to a new world. 

Although a sequel to Bubble Bobble, the game inaugurates few changes to the gameplay formula of that title. The small changes that have been made are that a boss is now encountered every five to ten levels, giving those scenes a similar prominence to Rainbow Islands, and the player takes a branching route through the levels by selecting one of two doors after every boss. 

The players can now charge the bubble shot; if released when the dragon's horns or bow is glowing, he/she will breathe three bubbles at once, with the specific formation dependent on the character chosen. The players must collect certain square cards with music notes inside, in order to get the 4 keys that lead to the final world or face an early false ending. Also, the characters have to collect a rod to turn their characters from their dragon to human forms during the course of the game. 

Bubble Bobble II is a beta/prototype game developed for the PlayStation by East Point Software. The game was never released on the PlayStation but did appear on the Sega Saturn in retail. Bubble Bobble 2 on the PlayStation is more colorful than the Saturn version.</desc>

Gameplay presents a blend of puzzle and action that sees players strafing from side-to-side, shooting vertically at the bubbles that bounce around the arena. Enclosed within the confines of a single, 2D arena, one or two players must utilize their rope-gun devices to destroy the deluge of bubbles that inundate the screen. When hit, the bubbles burst into multiple, smaller segments, and will continue to do so until the smallest bubble is destroyed. Only by clearing the screen can players proceed. However, coming into contact with a bubble will result in the immediate loss of a life.</desc>

		<name>Castlevania Chronicles [USA]</name>
		<desc>This Castlevania game was originally released on the Sharp X68000 (a home computer relatively unknown outside of Japan) but never made it to the worldwide audience. This conversion is meant to fix that, a remake of the original for the PlayStation with a good deal of new features.

This game plays very much like any old platform game on the NES (specifically, it plays just like an old Castlevania), you walk slowly forward killing any demonic creature you meet. The game is mostly sideways, though you can jump or walk onto the platforms here and there. The game plays like an old game, but looks like a new one with completely remade 2D graphics, with FMV cutscenes, arranged high quality music and more.</desc>

		<path>./Chrono Cross (USA) (Disc 1).PBP</path>
		<name>Chrono Cross [USA]</name>
		<desc>Chrono Cross is a sequel to the SNES RPG  Chrono Trigger.

The main character is Serge, a young boy from a fishing village. One day, while strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger.

Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each battle. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of attacks: weak, medium, and strong. Strong attacks tend to miss more frequently. Magical spells are equipped by each character like items, and can be cast only as many times as they are equipped. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount of stamina, which recovers as other characters act. 

Chrono Cross features many recruitable characters (up to 40, but not all of them can be recruited in one play-through), several different endings, and the ability to play the game again with the same stats and items from the previous play.</desc>

		<desc>Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within, released in Japan as Clock Tower Ghost Head, was released in 1998 for the PlayStation. While sharing the gameplay mechanics of the first two, the game could be considered a spin-off from the main series. The story follows 17-year-old Alyssa Hale who suffers from multiple personality disorder with an alter ego named Mr. Bates. It received overwhelmingly poor reviews, with critics citing the disjointed story and trial-and-error gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Command &amp; Conquer [USA]</name>
		<desc>Command &amp; Conquer developed ideas from Westwood's previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy game which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.

The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.

In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.

The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

		<name>Contra : Legacy Of War [USA]</name>
		<desc>Colonel Bassad, a dictator of a small country, has become a threat and is amassing an army of soldiers, robots, and alien mutants. Bassad has allied himself with an unknown alien entity for his bid to world domination. Ray Poward (returning from Contra: Hard Corps) is deployed to thwart Bassad's scheme along with three of the newest members of the Hard Corps team: Tasha, a female mercenary; CD-288, a robot; and Bubba, an alien. After making the way to Bassad's Mountain Stronghold, the team defeats him in his armored pod, but is dragged into his mind for a final battle. With Bassad defeated, they are teleported to the alien entity, which turns out to be a small living planet. With it destroyed, the team is drifted in space, and a surviving small alien bug is seen hiding.

Each character plays exactly the same except for the type of weapons they wield and their movement speed. All characters start with a machine gun and flamethrower, but the remaining two slots are for character specific weaponry. The game plays from an isometric angle. Since the game takes place in three dimensions, enemies come from all angles. Ducking and strafing have been added to the player's abilities, as well as an auto-aiming feature to help attack airborne enemies. Jumping has been slightly changed as the characters no longer do tightly curled somersault jumps (a feature in every previous game since the arcade version of the original Contra). The player's progress can be saved to a memory card.</desc>

		<name>Cool Boarders [USA]</name>
		<desc>The first title in the long-running PlayStation snowboarding series.

Imagine riding down the slopes, avoiding the trees and trying to hit the jumps. When you catch enough air, you grab your board, twist, and land a perfect trick. 

Choose from several different riders and 10 boards, and then hit one of the five courses. On each track you can earn three different trophies: one trophy is awarded for getting down the hill in the quickest time; catch big air to pull off big tricks to earn the highest trick point trophy; or win the final trophy by getting the highest total score, which is based on both time and trick points.

If the competition seems a little rough, race against the ghost from your last run and find a smoother line down the mountain.</desc>

The series is set in a pastiche Gothic horror universe and features a highly stylized, cartoonish graphic style. It features characters based on either various kinds of monsters (the titular "darkstalkers") or their hunters, who are all engaging in combat against each other. Darkstalkers introduced many of the concepts used in later Capcom fighting games, including its first use of 16-bit color animation sprites and gameplay mechanics later employed in the Street Fighter Alpha and Marvel vs. Capcom series.</desc>

Play as Jedah, B. B. Hood, Q-Bee, Lilith, Demitri, Morrigan, Anakaris, Victor, L. Raptor, Hsien-Ko, J. Talbain, Felicia, Rikuo, Sasquatch, Bishamon, Donovan, Pyron or Huitzil, and conquer the enemy.</desc>

		<desc>The first in the Dead or Alive series, and features many of the same features that has made the DoA series so popular today; somewhat realistic combat, good character design, and scantily clad women whose breasts bounce a lot.

The game doesn't mess too much with a background story- it's a 3D one on one fighter that takes place within an arena of limited space.  Each character has their own unique way of fighting, their own abilities, and even their own hobbies and likes.  (For example, Ryu Hayabusa- yes, he of Ninja Gaiden fame- likes sushi, mountain climbing, and fishing.)</desc>

The amount of points you get depends on how you hit them ... e.g. you get more points for getting them do a 360 other than driving into theirs sides at high speed. The game has more to offer: a head to head mode with only two cars or the legendary destruction derby itself - a huge arena, every car starts at the edge of it, and then - have a nice crash!</desc>

Die Hard 1 is a third person shooter in a style similar to Tomb Raider.  You are John McClane and must fight through twenty floors of terrorists in the Nakatomi Plaza.  The game has an invisible wall effect which allows you to see John even in small hallways.

Die Hard 2 is a first person rail shooter in the vein of Virtua Cop or Mad Dog McCree.  Once again you take the role of John  McClane firing upon terrorists who happen to be ransacking the Washington/Dulles Airport in search of a South American dictator and druglord.

Die Hard 3 is a fast-paced taxi racer through the city.  John must this time speed through New York City defusing bombs and ramming evildoers off the road behind the wheel of a cab.</desc>

		<name>Dino Crisis [USA]</name>
		<desc>An abandoned research complex on a remote jungle island, a team of special forces operatives, a horde of vicious velociraptors, and one big, mean Tyrannosaurus rex constitute the setting and cast of Dino Crisis, the latest masterpiece from the makers of Resident Evil.
 Dr. Edward Kirk is supposed to be dead. Three years ago while working to establish a new type of energy technology code-named Third Energy, an experiment went awry and terminated the brilliant scientist's life -- or so it was thought. It was recently learned, however, that Dr. Kirk is very much alive and continuing his work at a Borginia Republic research facility on Ibis Island.
 In order to investigate the situation, an elite special forces team including agents Regina, Gail and Rick was sent. The three expected another routine mission, but what they got was an all-out fight for their lives against an enemy they surely had never been trained to face -- dinosaurs!
 Luckily, Regina isn't restricted to limited firepower, as she'll come across shotguns, dart guns, and other weapons throughout the island. To gain access to the keys, code disks, and ID cards necessary for continued exploration, Regina must solve a variety of puzzles.
 Dino Crisis has three possible endings with a great deal of secrets becoming available after each has been viewed. These include new weapons, new costumes, and a "Wipe Out" mode in which you must defeat a certain number of dinosaurs within a designated time period.</desc>

		<name>Dino Crisis 2 [USA]</name>
		<desc>The research on the mysterious Third Energy is being continued in secret, but then an entire island with the facility conducting this research and a neighbouring town has vanished, moving back in time to the dinosaur era. A military unit is sent to the past to save the survivors and retrieve the research data. But nearly all soldiers are massacred by dinosaurs. You take control of Regina and Dylan, who managed to escape this fate. Now you must find the survivors, retrieve the data, and get back to your own time. 

Dino Crisis 2 is a third-person action-adventure game, where you control the characters Dylan and Regina (switching from one to another at various points in the storyline). You will collect items and use them to solve puzzles while fighting the hordes of dinosaurs that inhabit the island. Much like Alone in the Dark, the game uses 3d models for characters, enemies and items and static 2D backgrounds for their surroundings. 

Initially, each character starts with a gun and a melee weapon, but more weapons, such as flamethrowers or rocket launchers, can be bought later in the game. The dinosaurs' attacks cause you to lose "vitality", which can be restored using healing items. Sometimes an attack will cause you to bleed and thus slowly lose health; specific health items stop the bleeding. 

For each killed dinosaur you receive "Extinction Points". By killing a couple of dinos in quick succession, you activate a 'combo' and thus get more points. The points can be used in "Save Shops" throughout the game to buy weapons, ammo (and cartridge upgrades which allow you to store more ammo within the weapon), healing items and "tools" (such as armor, more powerful melee weapons, or "cards" which allow you to get bigger combos). You can also save the game at these points. 

While wandering around the island, you'll find many documents and letters to read, including "Dino Files", which contain a flavor description of a dino species.</desc>

There is nothing else on the planet beside this island and the vast ocean surrounding it.

		<desc>In 2192, a new city, Selene, is built on the moon. Over the years, Selene grows larger, more powerful, and more independent of the Earth - to the point that the moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einhänders: flying machines with a "hand" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.

On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einhänders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.

The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very "industrial", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.</desc>

One or two players can assume the identities of these Elementals as they crusade for an unknown master toward a climactic battle. 

The story unfolds by means of fully-3D action levels interspersed with hand-drawn animation scenes.</desc>

		<desc>ESPN Extreme Games lets the player access three modes of play: Exhibition, New Season or a continuation of a season. Exhibition mode helps the player get to know the courses and equipment as well as get a feel for the controls. New season offers the player the chance to race against sixteen other competitors on any of the four racing machines competing for season points as well as money to upgrade equipment.

Choose between roller blades, a luge (basically a sit-down skateboard), a mountain bike, and the skateboard. The player can also determine which character they want to race with, each one having a unique skill on one of the apparatus. For example one might be top-notch at roller blading but be bad at bike-riding so there is no point choosing the bike with him/her. In a season, the player competes in the five locations - three times, twelve in all and each time the obstacles become more and more tricky to avoid as well as the other racers becoming faster and more agile. 

The tracks are:

 
Italy - Country roads leading down to a town area; 
Lake Tahoe - Twisting roads and strategically placed haystacks;
South America - Lots of caves and thin jungle roads; 
San Francisco - Hundreds of obstacles and hills; 
Utah - Falling rocks, secret routes, and some hungry looking crocodiles.</desc>

		<name>Millennium Soldier Expendable [USA]</name>
		<desc>The game is called Expendable in The United States and Millenium Soldier Expendable in Europe.

Taking place in 2463 AD, the world has been consumed in chaos and countless confrontations with a powerful, technologically advanced alien race known as the Charva that want Earth and the human race destroyed. Before things get too out of hand, the government is sending expendables into action. An expendable is one viewed as not worth saving; their lives are pretty much worthless and won't be missed incase something bad were to happen. In this case, they are genetically altered superhuman killing machines incubated and hatched from eggs.

This would be you, a cloned space marine.

Going solo or with a friend in the simultaneous two-player Cooperative mode, Expendable offers explosive third-person action from an overhead perspective with a single mission objective: to destroy the Charva forces and anything that even remotely resembles a threat to the human race. Sounds simple? It's not; not only are there hundreds of enemies to kill throughout infested marine bases, alien planets and city streets (over 20 levels in all), you're also competing against a dwindling time limit. You'll have to go sightseeing on someone else's time!</desc>

		<desc>The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full of life. All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

Set in a fantasy world with a technology level equivalent to that of the Second Industrial Revolution, the game's story focuses on a group of rebels as they seek to overthrow an imperial dictatorship. The game features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series. Final Fantasy VI was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Yoshitaka Amano, a long-time contributor to the Final Fantasy series, returned as the image and character designer, while regular composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the game's score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.</desc>

		<name>Chrono Trigger</name>
		<desc>What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle, little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention, and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.

Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in battle. 

The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely. 

The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.</desc>

		<desc>Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.
 As young Zidane Tribal and his party interrupted a renowned play and kidnapped Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, things began to fall apart. The queen fired cannons and decimated her kingdom in an attempt to prevent the terrorist organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives intact.
 Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time. An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of the crusade.
 Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages, the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.
 But what are the queen's true intentions?</desc>

Final Fantasy is an RPG/adventure came where you choose four characters (from six different character classes). It features turn based combat, kill monsters for gold / experience to advance levels and equipment. 

Final Fantasy II is also similar but has several different aspects. There is no experience system is not based off of killing monsters. The more you use a weapon/armor the more proficient you get at it. It also features a keyword system. During a conversion some words can be memorized then you can ask NPCs keywords to further the plot, get more information, etc.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy Tactics [USA]</name>
		<desc>Final Fantasy Tactics was a big move for the whole Final Fantasy franchise into different fields. Tactics combines traditional elements of the Final Fantasy series with a completely different game mechanics and battle system. It was the 1st game during Final Fantasy 32-bit era using a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters and a turn based strategy system.

In the game you build up a team by recruiting many available characters you meet during your travels and stocking up plenty of items, to defeat various enemies waiting on your path. The game features a very complex character class(job) system where each character begins his way with a job such as Squire or Chemist. Successfully participating in battles, characters can later select one of more advanced jobs, with a total of 19 to choose from. In addition there are certain monsters and computer controlled "guests" with their own jobs and special abilities available to learn. In total, over 400 abilities are available which leads to ultimate endless combinations!

The PSP version of game are mostly reiterates the original PSOne. For example, the visual presentation is almost a 1:1 copy of the original. It looks like PSOne version with zoomed-in camera to make it fit the PSP screen. However Square adds cel-shaded introduction movies and numerous animation sequences played after each chapter ends. Some maps were completely remade as well, but you still cannot skip event scenes.

Also PSP version features two new playable characters: Balthier, from Final Fantasy XII and Luso from Final Fantasy Tactics A2. Two new job classes also have been added - the completely new Onion Knight and the Dark Knight class which was available on the PSOne only after using a cheat code. There are two wireless multiplayer options available once you reach the world map (just go into a bar in any town). One is Coliseum (Versus Battle Mode), the second is Cooperative Challenge (team-mission).</desc>

		<desc>Front Mission 3 is the third main entry and the fifth entry overall in the Front Mission series. Like other Front Mission titles, Front Mission 3 is part of a serialized storyline that follows the stories of various characters and their struggles involving mecha known as wanzers.
While it is a tactical role-playing game, there is a stronger emphasis on role-playing elements as opposed to strategic elements in Front Mission 3. The game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. The player travels to locations on a world map. As the player progresses through the plot, new locations are revealed on the world map. Towns and cities act as intermission points where the player can organize and set up their units for the upcoming mission. New to Front Mission 3 is the Double Feature Scenario - this allows the player to experience two different scenarios that exist independently of one another within the game's storyline. In other words, the player can play through two stories; while they may share common events and environments, the stories are largely unique and in essence are fully-fledged games.</desc>

Command a powerful Tactical Assault &amp; Combat X-1 mech walker (that can also transform into a sleek hovercraft) and battle through 12 levels, each culminating in a showdown with a large boss character. Fortunately for you, fourteen different weapons are available to help you teach "crime doesn't pay." Feeling a little lonely? If so, a friend can join the action in cooperative play!

An additional game mode, Precinct Assault, has also been included. Precinct Assault is a strategy game that involves two teams (red versus blue) in an all-out battle for supremacy.

The Thiima had been aroused by the Amnelian army's use of the weapon A.N. (All-Nothing) to annihilate the world Blazar, whom Amnelia had been at war with over jurisdiction over the moon Mahsah. Determined to protect their existence, and long ago programmed to protect the universe from just such threats as A.N., the Thiima swarmed on Amnelia. Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters. Ultimately, two pilots "Sameluck Raida and Lutia Feen" are chosen to perform a decisive attack on the main Thiima base: Kazumn, a satellite of the planet Darius.</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet Legends [USA]</name>
		<desc>For those unfamiliar with the original Gauntlet and its various home versions, the action involved fighting enemies such as ghosts, demons and sorcerers spawned from square structures called monster generators. An overhead perspective allowed players the freedom to explore the maze-like levels while still being able to see everything around them.

The object of each stage was simply to destroy the monsters in your path as you searched for the exit leading to the next level. Gauntlet Legends takes this simple formula and adds a new story, distinct worlds and even boss characters to fight. Of course, there are still treasure and potions waiting to be found as well as various traps that could spell disaster for even the heartiest of warriors.

In order to help you survive the later levels (Gauntlet Legends consists of over 30 stages), characters can earn experience points that will eventually translate into added strength, speed, armor and health. The story behind the game involves a jealous brother (Garm) of a noble wizard (Sumner) who decided to gather 13 Rune Stones in order to raise a demon.

Once the stones were placed on the floor of Sumner's tower, a hideous monster named Skorn was awakened and promptly consumed its new "master." As one of four intrepid adventurers, your goal is to travel through the worlds making up the Gauntlet Legends universe to defeat the evil demon Skorne and his various followers (a rather unsavory lot of Grunts, Ankle Biters, Suiciders, Bomb Throwers and Death).

To help you fight the good fight, you'll be able to find food, special weapons and power icons that can all be stored in your inventory and used whenever your character needs them. Some of the weapons include a three-way shot, fire breath and super shot, while the power-ups include super speed, invisibility and Anti-Death Power (which allows you to steal health from the normally invulnerable Death).</desc>

		<name>Gex : Enter the Gecko</name>
		<desc>"Is it just me, or am I engulfed in flames?" is one of the many one-liners uttered by Gex, a wise cracking gecko who should check himself into television rehab; he's addicted to it. After saving the Television Realm from the evil Rez in his first adventure, the gecko was ready to kick back, relax, and watch a little television. Little did he know his adventure was just beginning.

One day, two secret agent goons showed up at Gex's doorstep. They inform him that Rez is back and looking for vengeance; the evil monster is planning to destroy the Television Realm once more...and possibly the world. When Gex tells them that he's retired and doesn't care, one of the goons hits the gecko on the head and takes him to a secluded place.

When Gex comes to, the mystery men plead with the gecko to take the cash and help destroy Rez for good...or at least make him disappear. With that incentive (the cash), the wise cracking lizard slips into his special agent suit and plunges headfirst into the Television Realm. Watch out, Rez -- Gex is back!</desc>

He teleports to the batcave-like lair he has in the Media Dimension, and begins another adventure.

		<desc>After a violent interstellar resource war, mega-corporations seize power from the remnants of Earth's governments and lead humanity's way into the colonization of space. The last vestige of central authority is in the form of the G-Police (Government Police); an independent agency tasked with keeping order in the colonies. You play as rookie Jeff Slater - a former military pilot going undercover at the G-Police squadron on Callisto, in the hopes of finding the truth behind your sister's sudden death.

G-Police is an arcade-style helicopter shooter set inside the colony domes on Callisto. You pilot a futuristic close-air-support gunship, and are tasked with engaging ground and air enemies as you uncover a sinister corporate plot. Your ship can hover and turn in a VTOL mode, fire weapons outfitted before each mission, and lock on to objects in the world to both track enemies and scan suspicious cargo. Missions require you to navigate through the skyscrapers and billboards of the various city districts, and complete a number of objectives updated through radio contact with headquarters.</desc>

		<desc>Gran Turismo 2 is fundamentally based on the racing game genre. The player must maneuver an automobile to compete against artificially intelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: arcade and simulation. In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose the courses and vehicles they wish to use. However, the simulation mode requires the player to earn driver's licenses, pay for vehicles, and earn trophies in order to unlock new courses. Gran Turismo 2 features nearly 650 automobiles and 27 racing tracks.</desc>

		<name>Grand Theft Auto 2</name>
		<desc>The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.

Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.

New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.</desc>

		<path>./Grandia (USA) (Disc 1).PBP</path>
		<name>Grandia [USA]</name>
		<desc>Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters, that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997.  It centers around the story of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the 'Spirit Stone'.  The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world. Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.

The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.  Combat itself occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.

The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.  There are a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.</desc>

		<name>Guilty Gear</name>
		<desc>In 22th century, the scientists, learning the ancient ways of magic, discovered a new technique that made it possible to create artificial beings by mixing the DNA of humans and animals. Those new creatures were called "gears". They had no will of their own and were destined to obey the humans forever. However, a gear named Justice was, for a mysterious reason, capable of disobeying the humans and making decisions of his own. He organized a rebellion of gears, that was later repressed by the knights of the Sacred Order, who put him in a prison. But recently, Justice broke free, and the Order organized a tournament to find out who is capable of hunting him down again. Among the main contestant is a man with unclear past, Sol Badguy, and his rival Ky Kiske, one of the most skilled knights of the order. The conditions of the tournament are, however, very strange. It is allowed to spill blood, and the first prize is also not very usual: any wish of the winner will be fulfilled...

This is a 2D fighting game, in which you can play as one of 10 very different kind of characters. There is a selection of fighters from Holy Order knights, Armed Air Force soldiers, Mafia members and mad scientists. Each character has his/her own storyline that will be fully revealed during the final showdown. In battles, you can charge up for special attacks, as well as perform Deathblow moves, which would kill the opponent instantly. You can either choose to finish the Arcade mode, challenge your friends to a Versus battle, or either train your skills out in the Training mode.</desc>

Instead of being a continuous loop, these tracks have checkpoints at either end of the course, and the starting grid in the center. Characters race to one end, then turn around to head for the other checkpoint, repeating the process until all laps are complete. This provides a new gameplay dynamic as often the player must navigate oncoming traffic.[1] Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and Butterfinger, similar to real-life sponsored racing.</desc>

While a Jet Moto hoverbike might look like a jet ski, it is capable of far more: it travels across land as well as water and can use a magnetic grapple to make extremely tight turns. During a race, drivers must skillfully time jumps, dodge obstacles, and contend with some feisty opponents who won't hesitate to bump you into a tree or maybe even knock you off a cliff.

Jet Moto 3 offers ten different riders and 19 tracks across the wide open ocean, over mountainous terrain, and through cityscapes. As with the earlier games, two people can still race in a split-screen mode.</desc>

The player moves the protagonist, Klonoa, along a path in a two-dimensional fashion, but the game is rendered in three dimensions. This allows the path followed to curve and for the player to interact with objects outside of the path. The game is divided into levels called "Visions", where the player progresses by following a path with defeatable computer-controlled enemies and puzzles that must be solved. At the end of some levels, the player must defeat a boss - a powerful enemy.

		<name>Krazy Ivan [USA]</name>
		<desc>In the early 21st century, the Earth is under attack by aliens. In five areas of the planet, they have erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also taken hundreds of humans prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed "Krazy Ivan". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.

The player controls Ivan's "Steel Cossack" power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel Cossack. Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.

The Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge shields or rearm weapons.

After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech's armor.

Between the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.</desc>

		<path>./Legacy of Kain - Soul Reaver (USA).PBP</path>
		<name>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</name>
		<desc>1500 years after Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain's decision at the end of that game has finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the "insolence" of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss.  There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...

Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.  Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark gift") upon drinking it's soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.

The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes  requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are "block puzzles", requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.</desc>

		<path>./Legend of Dragoon, The (USA) (Disc 1).PBP</path>
		<name>The Legend of Dragoon</name>
		<desc>Ten thousand years ago the Legend was born. The Divine Tree's mystical powers were said to have given birth to all life. The 105th race born of the Tree was the mighty Dragons. The 106th was the human race and the 107th was the Winglies. Peace and tranquility reigned throughout the land, but suddenly a violent uprising occurred, led by the Winglies, who enslaved humanity. To counter this, the humans acquired the Dragons' spiritual forces and defeated their nemeses, which led to eventual harmony between all. However, the prophecy has only begun as the past and future are about to collide...
 In Sony's role-playing game, The Legend of Dragoon for the PlayStation, you'll travel across the land searching for clues and discovering new enemies as well as friends you can add to your party. Up to three members per party can fight at once, in an interface that Final Fantasy fans may find familiar, the difference being that you can become a Dragoon with supernatural powers taken from the souls of Dragons. Animals will attack you from nowhere while other creatures and even human opponents will specifically seek and destroy.
 Each warrior has his or her own weapons and magic, with the ability to retreat a fight based on chance. Experience points will add up and each member of the party will gain a level as their hit points increase. The combat technique known as Dragoon Additions -- shown as SP (Spirit Power) -- measures a Dragoon's ability to fight. When your character approaches an enemy upon initiating an attack, a rectangular grid targets the enemy before your weapon is swung. If you press it in time for the outer rectangle to close in, matching the center rectangle, you'll be able to hit your target and continue to get in several more hits depending on how fast and accurate you are executing the button sequence.
 Magical attacks draw their power from the Elements such as water, fire, wind, earth, darkness and light, thunder, and non-elemental. Using the opposite of an enemy's element will inflict the most damage. The game also consists of another unique fighting technique that is more commonly used: the Multi-Attack. It allows one to inflict more damage than normal. When it is used, the X button appears onscreen and you must rapidly tap the X button to increase the power of the attack to over 100 percent. If you do nothing, you will only inflict a small amount of damage. There is also the interactive counterattack which, if not properly done, will cut off the rest of your combos and damage your fighter as a result.
 Arm yourself with a variety of weapons such as swords, spears, bows and arrows, axes and hammers. Protect yourself with body armor, helmets and boots. Other items like bracelets, amulets or stones carry with them magical powers to enhance attacks or deflect the damage of an attack. Although your journey begins with only basic weapons, others can be purchased from merchants or found in chests. Changing and upgrading weapons for the entire party can be done via the in-game menu, however some weapons are specialized for particular warriors. There are also items that can heal or wage war and they too are won in battle, found in chests, or purchased from merchants.
 Although you start out as Dart, a brave and loyal warrior swordsman sworn to avenge his parents' death by the Black Monster, other party members you'll run into have their own unique story to tell. Saving the game is done wherever you find Save Points; the only requirement is that you must have at least two blocks of memory available on a memory card. This one-player game is also analog and vibration compatible and comes on four CDs.</desc>

		<path>./Legend of Legaia (USA).PBP</path>
		<name>Legend of Legaia</name>
		<desc>Legend of Legaia is a console RPG who's main innovation is its complex and unusual battle system.

Your initial party consists of three characters: Vahn, Noa, and Gala - two males and one female. You engage yourself on a quest of freeing your planet from a mysterious mist which is floating above the planet and which can turn anything it touches into a dreadful monster. In order to clean the planet from the horrible mist, you have to find so-called Genesis Trees which are scattered around on the planet. 

The combat system, which is probably the most original part of this game, isn't quite similar to the well-known menu-based Final Fantasy style. If you are familiar with the combat system of Xenogears, it's more similar to this one, but more complicated. Your choices aren't just attack, defend or use special abilities: the attack option itself has many choices: high-attack, low-attack, kick etc., a bit like in Revenant. Apart from this system, the game is a typical Asian console 3D RPG with manga characters, map-exploring, etc.</desc>

In Legend of Mana you control a hero or heroine traveling over the land of FaDiel. The game features a land creation system, allowing you to create new locations and story elements by placing mysterious artifacts. Those ancient artifacts are repositories of the land´s long-forgotten memories and the many events that once took place there. As the game advances, you will receive more artifacts and find out more about the land. At home you can raise pet monsters and create powerful golems, forge mighty weapons or refine musical instruments. On your adventures you can meet various interesting characters and fight against gruesome monsters.

The game is extremely non-linear in terms of gameplay. You can explore areas in any order and play through 67 related scenarios. Eventually you will resurrect the Mana Tree and discover the Legend of Mana.</desc>

		<name>Myst [USA]</name>
		<desc>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</desc>

		<desc>Those nasty Glukons are at it again, intent on oppressing the loveable Mudokons any way they can. Last time, the meanies were manufacturing Mudokon jerky. Now, they've officially taken genocide too far, by forcing blind Mudokons into slave labor to dig up the bones of their fellow deceased. It so happens, by the way, that Mudokon bones add just the right kick to a favorite Glukon recipe, Soulstorm Brew.
 Who's gonna save the day? Our unlikely hero Abe, of course. You remember Abe: that blue-green, loincloth-wearing, six foot-tall Fraggle with chronic digestive problems? Yep, he would have been content to rest on his laurels after rescuing ninety-nine of his Mudokon buddies from extermination in Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, but a group of disgruntled ghosts elected good ol' Abe to avenge their deaths.
 What's a Mudokon to do? Well, use your wits, words, and wiles to infiltrate the Soulstorm Brew factory, and get you and your buddies out alive, of course. Sound easy? Didn't think so. Each room, fully rendered in charming 2D, is brimming with booby traps and armed guards. What's more, it's tougher to get your enslaved buddies' attention this time. Mudokons now come in six different flavors: "normal" (that's a laugh), wired, depressed, sick (drunk, actually), and blind.
 Depending on the individual's physical or emotional state, you've got to interact with him in a particular way to get him to respond to Abe. To compensate for this, the development team at GT Software has beefed up their trademark "GameSpeak" feature. Abe is now capable of eight different utterances, including: "work!" "all o' ya!" "sorry," and a couple of unintelligible grunts and growls. And, yes, Abe still farts, although it's not absolutely necessary to do so.</desc>

		<desc>Twenty years after Pac-Man's first adventure in Pac-Land, Pac-Man returns one day to his house only to find it deserted.  Toc-Man and his ghosts have kidnapped Pac-Man's friends, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac Jr., Baby Pac, Professor Pac, Pooka, and Chomp-Chomp the dog!  Pac-Man must venture to Toc-Man's lair on Ghost Island to rescue his friends!

Hidden through this side-scrolling, 3D adventure game, Pac-Man faces challenging puzzles and games that have appeared in Pac-Man's previous games.  Many things in this game are a tribute to original games and even Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde are back for another chance to get Pac-Man.

There are several kinds of gameplay modes available.  The newest is Quest mode.  Pac-Man can maneuver up/down and left/right on the screen, but the camera is fixed on the side and scrolls along as Pac-Man searches through all the stages of Ghost Island.  The player must collect Pac-Dots, Fruit, Keys, etc to advance through the level all the while defeating ghosts (by bouncing on them) and solving puzzles.  An adventure game, the story progresses as the levels do with switches to be found and chests to be opened.  There is also a scoring system that encourages the player to collect as much as possible.  Make sure you have a Memory card available before starting out on Pac-Man's lengthy quest!

The other two types of modes are Classic mode and Maze mode.  Classic mode is a 100% faithful conversion of Pac-Man's original game.  Maze Mode is the gameplay from Classic Pac-Man translated into a 3D environment.  All the Pac-Pellets, Ghosts, Walls, and Pac-Man are displayed in very pleasing 3D.</desc>

While attending a "Wizards in Training" seminar, Nikki accidentally casts a powerful magic spell, which results in a giant monsters swallowing the whole village. The three friends must now travel to a place called "Wishing Engine", and be granted a wish to revert the world back to normal.

The characters each have a special movement to kill enemies with. The game uses floating camera angles through a vast Prince of Persia-style world. The goal of the game is to clear the various levels, avoiding spikes and enemies and collecting coins for extra lives.

Unlike most 3D platformers, Pandemonium offers only two-dimensional movement, rather than complete freedom of movement. The characters move along a curving 2D course within a 3D environment.</desc>

It is the year of Cheese, and the advent of the Comet of Infinite Possibilities is foretold by the great prophet Nosewasinit. Naturally, Nikki and Fargus are interested in this comet; but they are not the only ones. The evil Goon Queen Zorrscha wants to use the comet for her own plans, so our heroes have to reach it first...

The gameplay is similar to that of the first game; despite the 3D graphics, the gameplay mechanics are those of 2D platformers. The player can select Nikki or Fargus for each level. Each of the two has different abilities. For example, Nikki can jump higher, while Fargus can use his puppet Sid for a variety of attacks. The characters can also acquire power-ups, such as fire and lightning ranged attacks for Nikki or various Sid enhancements for Fargus. There are also level-specific items and vehicles the heroes will encounter on their way.</desc>

		<desc>The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny Funny, and going out on a date with her.  But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!

PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.

Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!

The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.</desc>

		<name>Parasite Eve [USA]</name>
		<desc>An ordinary day in New York for rookie police officer Aya Brea. Christmas Eve is the present day, and you've decided to visit the opera theater. Now this is where the fireworks begin. Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you're always on duty, so you must confront the danger.

There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already started.

The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers, you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items, or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects. The same is true for armor Aya finds.</desc>

Defeating enemies rewards money as well as points used to revive and power-up Aya's suppressed Parasite powers, like healing and igniting foes. Weapons and armor now have fixed stats, but attachments can be swapped in and out of them to modify their properties.

After surviving the events of Parasite Eve Aya left her job as a cop and became a member of MIST (Mitochondrion Investigation and Suppression Agency) in order to hunt down the remnant mutants spawned by Eve's awakening. In the year 2000 a new breed of Neo Mitochondrion takes over the Akropolis Tower in downtown LA. Aya is called in and uncovers a secret organization that threatens all humanity.</desc>

Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.</desc>

Since worlds that have any kind of development are off limits for corporate planetary development, Terracom is hiring Terran and alien soldiers through a directive known as "Project Overkill" to "unpopulate" desirable locations.
In response, a corporate leak has hired mercs to fight against the injustice of Terracom with the ultimate goal: destroy "Project Overkill."

Take on the role of four ruthless mercs as you rack up the body count through over 50 different missions with multiple paths.  One of the earlier releases for the Playstation, Project Overkill uses a 3D rendered, 3/4 perspective to deliver loads of blood-drenched mayhem.</desc>

Rayman embarks on strange quest to save the Great Protoon and his tiny followers from the evil Mister Dark. Since the land relies on the Great Protoon to maintain balance and harmony, the planet is now in chaos. Guide Rayman across 70 cartoon-like levels while facing over 50 bizarre baddies trying to put the limbless hero out of commission.
 Along the way, you must attempt to free singing creatures called Electoons from their cages. Don't expect a walk in the park, however. The enemies have been designed to learn your playing style in order to defeat you. Acquire new moves and abilities as you progress through the world, and return to earlier levels to find hidden secrets. Rayman offers CD-quality sound effects and music, vibrant vistas featuring 65,000 colors, and four layers of independently scrolling backdrops. A memory card with two blocks of free space is required to save progress.
 Features:
 * Help Rayman rescue the Electoons
 * Includes 70 levels and more than 50 characters
 * Graphics feature 65,000 colors and independently scrolling backgrounds
 STORY:
 Embark on a strange quest to save a world's Great Protoon and rescue little Electroons from imprisonment. You see, the world of Rayman relies on the Great Protoon to maintain balance and harmony for every living creature.
 The problem is that the evil Mister Dark has decided to capture him (it?) to throw the planet into chaos. This is where you come in! Guide Rayman through 70 cartoon-like, side-scrolling levels facing over fifty bizarre characters trying to put you out of commission.
 Along the way, free the Electroons who have been forced into cages by the baddies. Don't expect a walk in the park, however. The enemies will actually learn your playing style in order to defeat you! Acquire new moves and abilities as you progress through the world and return to earlier levels to find hidden secrets. Rayman also features CD-quality sound effects and music, 65,000 colors, plus four layers of independently scrolling backdrops to mesmerize you while playing. Don't just stand there gawking, the Great Protoon awaits!
 GAMEPLAY:
 The Rayman character is perfect for little children, though this game is easily difficult enough for adults. 60 levels for Rayman to conquer and none of them is easy, not even the first levels, because you have to get used to controlling Rayman.
 Sometimes the difficulty can be quite annoying, but luckily, if you get by a clown holding a camera and let him take your picture, you can save your progress in a level. On the world map there's also points where you can save after completing a level, it doesn't take much space in you system memory. A problem is, that when you completed all levels in the game, you still haven't beaten mister Dark.
 To get to this final level you must find each of the six cages of Electoons in each of the 60 levels. So if you can't find one cage, completing the game is impossible. A very good thing in the game is that the further you get in the game, the more abilities you get. For example, Rayman can hang on an edge, helicopter, use his glove to beat enemies, that sort of thing.</desc>

		<name>SaGa Frontier 2 [USA]</name>
		<desc>The sequel to  Saga Frontier, but also to the less known SNES  Romancing SaGa series, "Saga Frontier 2" allows you to play the stories of two main characters - a young prince Gustave XIII, who has been exiled from his homeland because he was unable to use the mysterious power of Anima and to become a worthy successor to the throne, and William Knights, a treasure hunter, who strives to find ancient artefacts containing great powers. Their stories are connected to each other, and each story occupies almost a lifetime: the characters grow up and die, new characters are born, etc. 

"Saga Frontier 2" continues the non-linear gameplay traditions of the SaGa series. You can visit all towns at your wish and at any time, recruit anyone to your party, and freely upgrade your party members by gaining new abilities and distributing them among your characters. You can learn magic spells by collecting artefacts, and combining them to produce more powerful types of magic. Similar to Konami's  Suikoden series, there are three types of combat: one-on-one (duel), turn-based party combat, and strategic army battles.</desc>

		<desc>San Francisco Rush Extreme Racing for the PlayStation is based on the 1996 hit arcade game by Atari Games. Players will race through locations based on San Francisco cities, rural areas, and suburban neighborhoods. Environments can also be cycled through day, night, and snow conditions in order to add some variety and challenge to the racing action.

Players can alter their view of their car from a third-person perspective to a first-person view looking through the windshield. There are eight available cars to choose from that vary in speed and control as well as four difficulty levels (Beginner, Advanced, Expert, and Extreme). The higher the difficulty, the more control is sacrificed in order to increase the maximum speed. Car colors can also be customized to your liking, and there is a choice between manual and automatic gear transmissions.</desc>

		<name>Silverload [USA]</name>
		<desc>SilverLoad is the title of a graphic adventure video game produced by Vic Tokai in 1996. In this single-player game, you control, via a first person perspective, a Wild West cowboy as he ventures into a haunted town in order to save two children that were taken from their parents.

The U.S. based Entertainment Software Ratings Board gave the game a "M" rating for its graphic violence, blood and gore, and bits of profanity. The game was released for the personal computer in Europe, and the original PlayStation edition was given an international release.

As is the case with other graphic adventure games, progress in SilverLoad involves finding and interacting with various "hot spots" in order to pick up objects, solve puzzles and interact with (or kill) the various characters in the town. Picking up certain objects will cause the game's (and town's) clock to move forward, and thus, the trick to success is to pick up the right items in the precise order. Otherwise, you have to restart the game from the beginning, or from wherever you saved the game.</desc>

		<desc>In the 16th century, a sword surfaces that is so powerful, so evil that warriors from all over the globe seek it out. It is Soul Edge, a demon blade. From America to Europe to Japan, these warriors fight each other for the chance to obtain it. Soul Blade is a 3D weapons fighting game that chronicles their story.

A complete 3D fighting game that allows for side steps, Soul Blade has twelve colorful fighters (ten standard, two hidden, plus additional costumes for a few fighters), each with various weapons and styles. The first ten can be used in all the combat modes, while the hidden two can only be used in versus and arcade mode.

Namco enhanced the arcade version (called Soul Edge) by adding a well done CGI intro, plus a story mode to the addition of the traditional team, survival, and time attack modes. The story mode goes into greater detail about each character, and is presented in an ancient book format. The story mode also allows you to unlock more of each characters' extra weapons. These weapons, which vary in lengths, stats, and durability, add to the options available players in the versus mode.

Soul Blade's sequel is SoulCalibur, both in the arcades and for the Sega Dreamcast</desc>

		<desc>The original Spec Ops for PC was one of the first realistic military tactical combat simulators to be released. After its limited success it spawned many rehashes, pseudo-sequels, and mission packs all bearing the same name. The Playstation's version of the rehash is Spec Ops: Stealth Patrol. Up to two players can simultaneously play through the series of missions the game has to offer. If there's only one player the second ranger is controlled by the CPU. The single player can switch between both rangers at any time, letting the CPU control the other ranger.

Join one of the most elite military task forces in the world--the U.S. Army Rangers. Play as a U.S. Special Operations Ranger Corps soldier in this third-person shooter. Your main objective: neutralize hostile terrorist threats around the world. With guns blazing or silently under the cover of darkness, navigate your team across harsh terrains of thick jungle, barren desert, arctic tundra, and dense forest. You must use stealth and tactics to your advantage. Oh, a few more squad members and weapons that range from sniper rifles to machines guns wouldn't hurt either. Take out terrorists, rescue hostages and save the free world...that's all this game is asking of you. Will you be able to complete your mission, even though you may be the lone survivor?</desc>

Finding a mysterious device in the center of it, Claude begins to examine it close-up, despite orders to keep away from it. As he approaches, the machine activates, teleporting him to Expel.</desc>

The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.

The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</desc>

Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)</desc>

The game features a number of improvements over the original. The graphics have been improved by making use of 2D animations placed on 3D backgrounds.

Strider now has a range of new moves including a double jump, backward somersault and dash, which allows him to perform longer jumps. He also has the ability to boost his weapon, the Cypher sword, enabling it to release homing plasma waves. There is also a Savage Slash attack, with random slashes.

There are numerous bonuses that can be collected in the levels. These either boost Striders vitality, increase the power of his sword or increase your game score.

A welcome addition to the game is a Boss Gauge which lets you know how much energy the mid- or end of level boss has left before it dies.</desc>

		<name>Suikoden [USA]</name>
		<desc>Loosely based on the classic medieval Chinese novel "Water Margins" (Shuihuzhuan) by Shi Nai'an. The game is a fantasy RPG set in an imaginary universe, its main theme being political struggle. The hero of the game is the young son of Theo McDohl, a general who serves the Scarlet Moon Empire, presently controlling the land of Toran. Through a series of events the hero becomes involved in a rebellion against the Empire, led by an organization known as the Liberation Army. Will the hero find a new home there, will he be able to tear himself away from everything that has been sacred to him, including his own father?

Suikoden is a console-style RPG with several unusual additions. There are three kinds of combat in the game, the most common one being the traditional turn-based party combat (players can have up to six people in their active party). Magic runes can be equipped on the player's characters which allow limited usage of offensive and healing spells. There are also army battles, where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians, etc., and one-on-one fights.

The game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as their home base and fortress.108 characters can be recruited in the game, a tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in "Water Margins". Many of those characters will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while others will act as strategy advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various ways.</desc>

As a member of the Alliance, a military force only really hinted at in the original, you play the unwitting hero of the game: an orphan who has been raised by a quiet, unassuming battle hero in a seemingly ancient war. Alongside you in the ranks is your best friend Jowy, a boy born of nobility but who has never been able to receive approval in his stubborn father's eyes. As the game begins, you are immediately tossed into a tale of political strife, betrayal and war on a grand scale beyond your scope in the early stages. As the game wears on, the plot will twist, turn and develop in numerous ways that expose the personalities of each of the characters involved. The battle system is turn-based, with the option to equip Runes for special abilities, combine party member attacks to create chain combos or devastating spells, and the option to run the battle in Auto mode.</desc>

		<desc>A Tetris-like puzzle game featuring popular characters from many Capcom games.

Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.</desc>

		<desc>Tobal 2 is a sequel to Tobal Nr. 1. Like its predecessor, it is a fighting game with an additional Quest Mode, which has been expanded and added new features in this sequel.

The basic fighting gameplay is the same as in the first game, utilizing free movement in a 3D environment (provided the player character is facing the opponent) with high, medium, and low punches and kicks, as well as the trademark grappling and throwing moves. An unblockable fireball attack has been added in this installment.

The Quest Mode has undergone a significant expansion, including role-playing elements. In addition to the dungeons featured in the first game, the sequel adds an explorable town, where the main character can eat, rest, and buy supplies. An experience system has also been added. Consuming food and potions will have an effect on the character's attack and defense power. Individual attacks and body parts can be increased in strength as well.

Also new in the Quest Mode is the ability to capture encountered monsters and then use them as playable characters in the Vs. mode. The amount of playable characters in this fighting game can be therefore as high as two hundred.</desc>

Tobal No. 1 has various gameplay modes including a tournament mode, two player versus mode, practice mode, and the unique quest mode, all of which utilize the same fighting system. The game itself runs at up to a smooth 60 frames per second due to its lack of textured polygons and reduced details which gave the game a distinctive look in comparison to other fighting games at the time, such as Tekken 2. The game's controls are unique in that they allow full freedom of movement in the ring as long as the player faces the opponent. The player has the ability to dash and jump, and certain buttons execute high, medium, and low attacks for each character. Tobal No. 1 also has a unique grappling and blocking system, offering the player a variety of throws and counter moves.

		<path>./Tomb Raider (USA).PBP</path>
		<name>Tomb Raider [USA]</name>
		<desc>The central character in Tomb Raider is the English archaeologist Lara Croft, a female adventurer in search of ancient relics. Lara was created by one-time Core designer Toby Gard,[1] and grew out of a number of ideas discarded in early concepts. She appears almost invariably with brown shorts, boots and small backpack, a dark green or blue sleeveless top, holsters on both sides of her hip for dual wielded pistols.
 Tomb Raider is an action-adventure video game developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive. It was originally released in 1996 for the Sega Saturn, with MS-DOS and PlayStation versions following shortly thereafter. Tomb Raider was also released into the mobile gaming market, for Windows Mobile Professional in 2002, the Nokia N-Gage in 2003. The game was released for the PlayStation Network in the U.S. in August 2009, and in Europe in August 2010. Tomb Raider follows the exploits of Lara Croft, an English female archaeologist in search of ancient treasures.
 STORY:
 The story opens with a prologue in Los Alamos County, New Mexico. A great explosion causes an earthquake and exposes an ancient device buried beneath the desert surface. The device unlocks and reveals a person in suspended animation. The story then continues in the present day.
 In Tomb Raider, Lara Croft hunts for pieces of a talisman called the Scion, the first of which is found in the Tomb of Qualopec in Peru.
 At a hotel in present day Calcutta, Lara Croft is contacted by an American named Larson, who works for the wealthy businesswoman Jacqueline Natla, owner of Natla Technologies. At Natla's request, Lara sets out on an expedition to recover a mysterious artefact called the Scion from the lost tomb of Qualopec, in the mountains of Peru. 
 GAMEPLAY:
 In Tomb Raider, you assume the role of a beautiful archaeologist, Lara Croft. She is a thrill seeker and is willing to do almost anything that puts her life in danger -- she enjoys it. Naturally, Lara jumped all over the opportunity to recover the powerful Scion, an ancient relic scattered throughout the caverns and temples of the world.
 Played from a 3rd person 3D perspective, her adventure spans over 15 levels set in 4 distinct worlds and environments. As Lara, you'll have to solve ancient riddles in the Egyptian Pyramids, discover the Lost City of Atlantis and traverse through Ancient Rome all while looking for the artifact. Each level is laced with traps and hazards that require you to flip, swim and climb your way to safety and success.
 Along the way, you'll engage in battle with countless enemies including wolves, bears and the occasional "extinct" dinosaur. Fortunately, you have a slew of weapons at your disposal. Lara's default weapon is dual pistols and as you progress further into the game, you'll come across shotguns, magnums and an Uzi. When the ammunition is running low, you'll have to make good use of her various maneuvers to avoid enemy contact.</desc>

		<name>Tomb Raider III : Adventures of Lara Croft</name>
		<desc>The amazing adventurer Lara Croft returns once again with the third release in the Tomb Raider series for the PlayStation, Tomb Raider III: The Adventures of Lara Croft. This time she has some new moves such as crawl, monkey swing, and speed dash to help her through tough situations.
			The story unfolds with some background on the current situation. In years past, British sailors discovered a meteor buried deep in the Earth. Unwittingly, they looted four artifacts found with the meteor. One of these sailors kept a journal as they headed back to England -- he was the only one to make it home alive.
			With that in mind, the game begins with several key elements falling into place that will eventually reunite the lost artifacts. Lara is in India searching for one of these precious items, unaware of its true history. She only knows that local beliefs state that the artifact was to contain great powers.
			It is up to you as Lara to use what little information you have at hand to begin your quest in finding the artifacts, and discovering their power.
			Tomb Raider III's graphics have been updated from the previous titles with a faster engine. Such improvements include more texture palettes for finer detail, improved water and reflection effects, smoother surfaces and real-time lighting effects.
			The story and gameplay are designed to unfold in a non-linear fashion, as in Lara's previous adventures, but even more so. This time gamers will be able to choose their own destiny by selecting the order in which they play each of the four main levels. The levels are also more open, with multiple routes to the same end. You may also choose to replay each level so you can avoid missing any part of the adventure.</desc>

The game starts out simple enough with the evil Koma Pigs stealing Tomba's bracelet, which was given to him by his grandfather. You assume the role of Tomba and begin your adventure. Little do you know that the quest for your bracelet will turn into so much more.

Because of its role-playing elements, in Tomba!, your character will gain experience points, develop new skills and learn new things.

Once all three experience meters reach level ten (in order to do this, Tomba must do certain things), he will unlock and learn an ability.</desc>

Though this third version of the title is being released on half a dozen platforms and considerable effort has been invested in assuring that the PS2, Xbox, and GameCube versions of the live up to their "next-generation" technological potential, Neversoft and Activision endeavored to bless this PS version with all of the third edition's key innovations while retaining and reinforcing the engaging, accessible gameplay which is the true crux of the series' success.

While it can't pump out the same amount of eye-candy as its counterparts on the 128-bit generation systems, this PlayStation release of THPS3 incorporates several of the new features designed to propel the series' popularity on other platforms. New landing tricks allow players to string together greater combinations, especially when moving from the ramps to the street. Environments are designed to test old and new skills alike. Loyal PS gamers should be pleased that all the important new levels, tricks, and combinations developed for the third edition of Tony Hawk Pro Skater are duly represented in this version of the game.</desc>

Environments are designed to seem even larger and more interactive in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, with less worry over time limits and more emphasis on exploration. The game also adds new tricks to the pro skaters' repertoires, allowing huge, point-packed combos. The "spine transfer" challenges skaters to zip up one side of a double ramp and down the other.

		<desc>Introducing Lammy, a totally rockin' guitarist.  In day-to-day life, she's quite timid, shy, and wimpy - but put a guitar in her hands, and she'll blow you away!  Help Lammy get to her latest gig on time, and face obstacles such as flaming buildings, out-of-control airplanes, and even getting trapped in Hell.

In this sequel to PaRappa The Rapper you play as Lammy, a guitarist for MilkCan - the coolest, hippest band ever!  While PaRappa focused on lyrics, with each button controlling a different word; Lammy is a guitar player, so naturally, each button controls a different note on the guitar.  Lammy will encounter seven different teachers on her travels to the big gig, so either follow their lessons accurately, or do even better - improvise and blow them all away with your axe.  The teacher will then step away for you to go it solo for an even better performance.

Lammy improves over PaRappa in a multitude of ways.  Rather than just being a single player experience, you can now play the game with a friend.  Any stages that you unlock can be played either co-operatively or competitively.  If you don't have a friend to play co-operatively with, you can also get the computer to take on the role of your partner.

		<name>Vagrant Story</name>
		<desc>Valendra is a land that had undergone civil war. The end of which had birthed the parliament and several organizations to control the balance of power. Ashley Riot is a Riskbreaker agent, an elite one man investigator, for the Valendia Knights of Peace (VKP) who is investigating some strange occurrences. A cult of religious fanatics known as Müllenkamp, and their leader Sydney Losstarot, have seized the manor of Duke Bardorba of Valendia Kingdom. The events at the manor have sent Ashley on a quest to get to the bottom of what's going on, and travel into the catacombs that lead to the destroyed, yet magical city of Leá Monde. However Ashley is not the only person interested in the city, and other factions of the government, including parliament assigned Knights of the Crimson Blade and other VKP agents are pursuing their own agenda. 

Combat is central to the game. The game runs in real time but when entering combat and attacking an enemy, the game is paused. A wireframe sphere showing the range of the currently selected weapon and detailed statistics on different body parts of the enemies within range.

The game features a range of weapons. Each weapon can be disassembled and reassembled in workshops scattered throughout the game, attaching gems for extra power. Weapons used constantly against the same type of enemy improve in power against them.

Ashley can also make use of Magic, Chain Abilities and Break Arts. Magic is broken into four groups, namely defense, combat, healing and status. Spells use up mana points and are sometimes more costly than useful. Chain Abilities allow Ashley to "chain together" consecutive hits against enemies. Break Arts are special skills learnt after repetitive use of a weapon type. Sacrificing some of the player's health, Break Arts can perform a high damage attack on an enemy.</desc>

		<path>./Valkyrie Profile (USA) (Disc 1).PBP</path>
		<name>Valkyrie Profile</name>
		<desc>In preparation for Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods, Odin has commanded Lenneth the Valkyrie to descend to the lower world and gather the souls of fallen heroes to serve as soldiers in the approaching conflict. You play as Lenneth, gathering soldiers and training them to be transferred to the battlefields of the gods.

The gameplay mainly consists of exploring various locations (dungeons, mansions, swamps) from a 2D perspective. Lenneth can run, jump, shoot ice crystals (useful for anything from freezing enemies to building ledges), push and pull objects to solve simple puzzles, etc. All of the enemies are on-screen and can usually be avoided, in the style of games like Chrono Cross and SaGa Frontier 2. The battle system is a mix of real-time and turn-based elements. Each of the characters (up to three can fight alongside Lenneth at a time) is assigned to one of the four main keys. The player and the enemy take turns attacking, but with the right timing, the player can execute combos that leave enemies defenseless. Long combos can result in substantial experience bonuses, although it is possible to defeat most enemies without them.

The rest of the game consists of Lenneth using "spiritual concentration" to discover the locations of dungeons and fallen heroes, ingame-engine cutscenes that give the history of these characters, and reports about the war's progress that come at the end of each "chapter". The chapter system is one of the game's most original features. Each chapter (there are about 8) is made up of a preset number of periods. Each action, such as a successful use of spiritual concentration, or entering a town/dungeon, uses a number of periods that varies with the difficulty level. When all of the periods have passed, the chapter is over. Since the player must transfer heroes to Valhalla in the course of each chapter (permanently losing them), but has only a limited amount of time to improve their statistics, the game has a sense of urgency and danger often absent from more traditional console RPGs.</desc>

		<name>Vandal Hearts [USA]</name>
		<desc>Vandal Hearts is a turn-based strategy RPG. It follows a fixed plot-line with set battles, focusing more on strategic elements than adventure elements. 

The combat takes place in a series 3D grid based maps and each character in the party has a certain amount of movements they can perform each turn. As the game progresses, other characters join and leave the party and as they increase in level they can progress along different paths of development. Between each battle there is a cut scene that develops the plot using the same 3D engine as the combat (and often the same areas).

In between battles you have the opportunity to talk to people in cities as well as purchase different equipment for the up coming battles.</desc>

		<path>./Vandal Hearts II (USA).PBP</path>
		<name>Vandal Hearts 2</name>
		<desc>Vandal Hearts II is a turn based strategic RPG which is comparable to the more famous Fire Emblem series.

Most of the gameplay consists of moving your party on 3D grid based maps in a way that will give you a strategic advantage over your enemies. The main difference between Vandal Hearts II and its predecessor is the change of the battle system. Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in in completely new strategies and gives the game a unique touch.

The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers. Caused by a chain of coincidences, the young boy Joshua, from a small and unimportant village in the east, eventually finds himself within a complex political scheme set in motion by power-hungry aristocrats and religious fanatics.</desc>

		<name>Warcraft II : The Dark Saga [USA]</name>
		<desc>Warcraft II: The Dark Saga brings the successful Warcraft series to the console world, delivering medieval orc vs. human combat to those that haven't been able to enjoy the PC version. Warcraft II is a real-time strategy game that requires players to build up orc and human forces by building structures and creating units for combat. The main objective is to take control of one race and wipe the other one completely off of the map.
 The console version of Warcraft II sports some changes from its PC predecessor. First and foremost, both the original version of Warcraft II as well as the expansion pack are included. This means twice as many maps and four separate campaigns, giving players 52 different missions split between the races. Other additions include six new full-motion video cut-scenes, and the ability to group sixteen units instead of nine. Also included are extra production options, meaning that if you control multiple bases, it will be easier to maintain one while focusing your attention on the other.
 While Warcraft II: The Dark Saga only features single-player missions, players can create their own maps, as well as use custom mission maps that the game includes to make their own scenarios.</desc>

		<desc>"Wild Arms 2" isn't really a sequel to Sony's original title. Your hero, a young soldier Ashley, is transformed to a demon. Ashley is determined to purge the evil from his body. He meets Brad, a criminal and a war-hero, and Lilka, a female magician. Together, they start a journey in order to discover the unknown foes which have corrupted Ashley, but soon they find out that a much greater conspiracy has taken place...

The combat system in "Wild Arms" is very similar to the one in Final Fantasy games: turned-based attacks, and a menu choice of physical attacks, spells, and even Guardians, which are more or less the same like the Guardian Forces in "Final Fantasy VIII". The "Arms" are special abilities which the party members learn while progressing in the game. 

"Wild Arms 2" also has many adventure elements, which links it to Nintendo's Zelda games. The dungeons (which can - and must - be viewed rotating the camera) contain many puzzles to solve.</desc>
