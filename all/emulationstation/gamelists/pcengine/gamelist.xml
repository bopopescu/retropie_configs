		<name>Adventure Island</name>
		<desc>Life as a roaming adventurer is never easy. One minute you're shoving several feet of cold steel between the gaping jaws of some evil robot dragon, and the next thing you know, you've been transformed into a fire breathing lizard man. Such is the problem that you first encounter at the beginning of Adventure Island, Hudson Soft's conversion of the Master System game 'Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'. Taking more of its influence from the second game in the Wonder Boy series than the first, Adventure Island has a more balanced structure and more exploratory gameplay.

The main game is centred around a small village which acts as a sort of 'hub' to the surrounding levels. Each of these levels are gradually accessed over time with the acquisition of keys or new transformations. As the game progresses, you will find yourself transforming into five different creatures, which can (and need to) be switched between in special rooms. The lizard is the basic transformation and does little more than breathe fire at any passing fauna. Mouse man is a tiny little critter and aside from being able to fit under small obstacles, he can also run up and around special chequered walls and ceilings. Next up is a green amphibian that gives you the power to swim around freely, followed by a tiger man who swings his sword around in a wide arc, allowing you to break blocks above and below. Finally, there is the bird transformation which lets you fly around by repeatedly tapping the jump button.

As you progress, your quest will take you over many types of terrain from jungle to desert to the inside of a giant pyramid - but to help you out there is a password/backup save feature in a church in the main village. As you viciously hack up the cute little inhabitants of the island, you find that they considerately drop money and helpful items for you. The money is used in shops to upgrade your armour, or buy healing at the hospital, while the other items are special weapons that can be set from the pause menu. These include homing fireballs, ground based mini whirlwinds and arrows that shoot directly upwards (and are a blessing when you are trying to get rid of flame-dropping clouds).</desc>

		<desc>The player controls a small craft through different levels with many enemies. Every level ends with a boss and some section speed up the gameplay, offering fast obstacle courses both horizontally and vertically scrolling. Flying orange pods release many power-ups at once, enhancing the ships with new or more powerful lasers, wing men and shields. The player can also hold the fire key to charge a blast that removes all enemy bullets from the screen and deals damage to all enemies. With an unforgiving difficulty, every hit is fatal, but the game can be continued from any points as long as there are lives and credits left. The game can be played with two players cooperatively.</desc>

		<name>After Burner II</name>
		<desc>One of Sega's big arcade hits using their 'super scaler' technology, it was a bold move to try and convert this to any home machine. After Burner II is, quite simply, one of the most mindless shooters that you're ever likely to play: simply fly your F-14 into the screen, dodging missiles like crazy and letting all hell loose with your vulcan cannon. There is precious little strategy - even less than Space Harrier, and often luck plays more of a part than skill. The action is split up by the occasional bonus stage - a run through a canyon blowing up anything that dares to exist in front of you. Fuelling planes and landing strips also make a regular appearance.</desc>

		<name>Aoi Blink</name>
		<desc>Based on a TV anime series (from the grandfather of manga Osamu Tezuka), Blue Blink is a cute platformer that manages to find its place among the crowd. The game is divided up into different areas, each represented by a map screen. Within these areas, you can choose your route to the end (by exiting levels at certain points). Throughout each area you have to find a 'master key' allowing you access to the boss - this can be hard to locate at times and requires lots of shooting at blank areas of screen just in case.

Control of your character is original - on each stage you have three characters which you can choose between, with the CPU controlled ones following behind you like some bizarre congo line. The characters are preset and vary from stage to stage, and each one has different attributes. For example, some have very high jumping ability, whereas others are poor at jumping but have spread-shot weapons. Once you have found the master key and reached the final level in the area, you are entered into a boss battle, where you sit astride the titular donkey and attempt to fight your way to the next area.</desc>

		<name>Atomic Robo-Kid Special</name>
		<desc>More of an explorative shooter than the standard blasting affairs, Atomic Robo-Kid Special takes all the elements from the arcade version and jiggles around with them a bit for the PC Engine. The control method takes a little getting used to - pressing button I selects from one of four weapons collected along the way, whereas holding down button I will lock you to the direction you are facing, making backing-away and firing easier. It can be fiddly at first, but it's essential that you master it.

The four weapons available are variable in quality. The forward shot and diagonal shot are both only useful when you've lost the other weapons, as the missile and full-fire are the ones that you will utilise most often. The missile is particularly useful as in some levels you are required to blast away areas of wall to progress. Levels are varied - some are horizontal, some are more like mazes and there are also two types of boss area: one with a small enemy over the opposite side of the screen protected by a barrier you have to destroy, and another with a huge mechanical monster that follows you relentlessly around an arena.</desc>

		<desc>Based on a manga, Bari Bari Densetsu is something of a rare breed on the Engine - a motorcycle racing game. You can pretty much guess how it works - there's a World GP mode where you have to compete in a variety of races in order and a Travel mode that let's you pick a track of your choice. Also to consider is the gubbins that make up your bike, such as tyres, engine, brakes etc as these have an effect depending on the type of course and the weather conditions. Races are started with a qualifying lap that lets you get the feel of the track, followed by the race proper. You are then placed and can hopefully move on to the next country.</desc>

You control what is basically a floating globe (complete with little man inside) that has a weapons ring around it - this ring can be rotated right around the ship giving a fully controllable direction of fire, something obviously useful for those pesky critters approaching from behind. From the start, you are equipped with several different types of weapon, each of which can be temporarily boosted by collecting items that are dropped by exploding enemies. The levels are auto-scroll, moving around in all directions and contain mid-level as well as end-of-level bosses. Your ship has an energy bar, located at the bottom left of the screen, and once it is depleted it's 'Game Over'.</desc>

		<name>Battle Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>Once an ancient arcade game, and with a previous version on the PC Engine by Pack In Video, Hudson Soft have taken the addictive gameplay of Lode Runner and given the graphics a complete face lift. The puzzle-based action in Lode Runner is simple: You are presented with a side-view platforms-and-ladders based level and you have to collect all the gold and escape without getting caught by the baddies. To defend yourself, you can dig holes in the ground, either to the left or to the right, and enemies stumbling upon them will fall down and be trapped. If you time it right, the hole will re-fill before the enemy can climb out, forcing them to respawn elsewhere in the level. If you prefer evasive action, make sure the coast is clear so you can escape up a ladder or across a well-placed rope, but be warned - they will follow! Once you have collected all the gold, hotfoot it to the nearest long ladder and escape out the top of the screen. In magazine previews, this was originally titled Lode Runner II.</desc>

Luckily, the balls themselves do have a use - give them a swift kick and they'll get rid of any creature barring your way. And if you are persistent, you can even whack down walls. Also, be on the lookout for various items scattered around that aid you in your task, like time-stops, smart bombs etc</desc>

		<desc>Puzzle games. Don't you just love 'em? Classics like Tetris, Puzzle Bobble, Klax....and then there's Blodia. The concept behind Blodia is very simple: 1-You have a screen of pipe-work. 2-There is a ball travelling down the pipe. 3-If the ball drops down a gap in the pipe you have to start again. That's it. So what this all amounts to is you frantically sliding the tiles around block-puzzle style to keep that cursed ball bearing on track. God forbid that you think the ball is moving too slowly, you can even push a button to speed the damn thing up, but you have to wonder why you would ever want to do that.

The range of Bomberman's bomb explosions can be upgraded with time, but if he dies, the range resets back to the minimum range and Bomberman loses his previous skills. Some updates can make Bomberman walk through the walls, increase his speed, and give him some other assets to aid him in his quest to save the woman he loves.

This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final one consisting of the boss that will have to be dealt with. Bomberman can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind him, thus evaporating the enemies, but beware: Bomberman can block himself with his own bomb, and thus become a victim of his own bomb.</desc>

		<desc>The Engine doesn't really have much in the way of pool games. In fact, this is the only one that I can think of. It looks and plays like those games you used to see in arcades and has plenty of options to choose from. Firstly you get to choose from simulation, action and technique (which lets you try out loads of trick shots). Then, you can play against other humans, your coach or try out the challenge mode that sets you up as a stowaway on a cruise liner, having to beat 14 opponents to be let off the hook! The play screen is laid out clearly - you aim by positioning a target anywhere on the table (unlike some games that make you aim to the cushion), then you can choose the regulars like spin and shot power.</desc>

Circus Lido, or Circus Ride, is an action game published by Uni Post exclusively for the PC Engine.

The goal of the game is to navigate the stage and defeat the enemies using the chameleon's two powers: his long tongue and his prehensile tail. The tongue can be used to capture enemies and spit them out towards the Venus flytraps, which are the only way to remove them from the stage. The tail can be used to climb vines scattered around, which allows the chameleon to ascend through the stage.</desc>

City Hunter is a side-scrolling action game exclusive to the PC Engine. The player controls Ryo Saeba, the eponymous "City Hunter" private eye who often takes assignments from attractive female clients. Despite his lechery, he's a highly competent gunman and very sharp when reading people.

The game is built similarly to Impossible Mission: Ryo explores buildings, checking doors for mission-critical NPCs and items while shooting the enemy thugs that attack him while investigating. It contains four stages, or "chapters", and appearances from various characters from the franchise like Ryo's partner Kaori Makimura, his rival Umibozu and his police contact Seiko Nogami.</desc>

		<path>./Columns (Japan).cue</path>
		<name>Columns</name>
		<desc>Columns was one of the many Tetris-like puzzles that appeared after that game's great success in the late 1980s. It takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen "Columns"

While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.

If, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.

Occasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel Column appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.

The columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with Jewels.

Some ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. "Flash columns" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. "Doubles" allows two players work together in the same well. "Time trial" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.</desc>

		<name>Cyber Knight</name>
		<desc>Cyber Knight is a science fiction Super Famicom and PC Engine role-playing video game that combines the exploration of Star Trek with strategic robot combat. This game is intended for experienced role-playing gamers only. The random encounters are high even for a Japanese role-playing game with a mid-to-late 1992 Super Famicom release date (i.e., Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride) and the combat sequences (using melee attacks in addition to missiles and guns) are extremely slow.

The game was only released commercially in Japan.

In the 24th century, mankind has expanded into the reaches of outer space.[2] Meanwhile, the Earth had already disappeared as the center of human civilization. Each star system served as independent nation; war had occurred between these "countries" several times in the past. This led to a high demand for mercenaries to fight these wars for money. Some of these mercenaries went on to become space pirates due to their insatiable demand for wealth.

The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates. Suddenly, the battle takes a turn for the worse and the crew activate their jump drive without a destination.  They end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties. Even the captain was killed while en route to the mysterious destination. Only 26 of the crew survive, and only six of them are qualified for combat operations: the commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor. They are responsible for using the six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them after the fight with the space pirates. They discover a human colony that is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers".

The crew must fight back against the new alien threat and explore the galaxy in order to find a way to return to Earth.</desc>

		<name>Dai Senpu</name>
		<desc>Daisenpū is a vertical shooter by Nec Interchannel and conversion of the arcade game of the same name (also known as Twin Hawk) originally released by Toaplan in 1989. In the year 193X, country R is overwhelmed by hostile enemy forces and the small oasis town 'S' is the main target of the attack. A handful of survivors escape to the jungle and start working on a counter attack - but they are soon discovered and are now running out of time, and they must launch the Daisenpū squadron before it is fully operational. The player takes control of a fighter plane and must fly deep into enemy territory, attack ground targets such as tanks, turrets and warships (the game curiously doesn't feature any flying enemies and no obstacles to fly into, beside enemy bullets). The plane starts equipped with a limited double-shot machine gun that can be slowly upgraded throughout the game by collecting power-pods left behind by small trucks. But the originality of Daisenpū lies elsewhere - the player can call a small squadron of six planes and have them fly in formation, shooting anything in sight and crashing into an enemy unit when defeated. The squadron can also commit a Kamikaze attack at anytime and destroy ground units, or combine to release a devastative bomb-attack. Finally, Daisenpū offers an unusual feature - levels do not pause between them and reveal instead a continuous flow of undisturbed shooting action.</desc>

		<name>Darius Plus</name>
		<desc>Amidst the clutter of arcade shooters in the late 1980s, companies needed to make their games stand out in some way. Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that "outer space" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.

Yes, fish.

Not even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.

The requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.

The arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.

Looking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.

Darius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.

When various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.

It was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, PC Engine, PC Engine (Super CD-ROM), Wii (Virtual Console), and ZX Spectrum.

The PC Engine saw three releases:  

Darius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published. You could only get a copy of this hardcore shoot-em-up by buying Darius Plus and Super Darius and then mailing coupons to the publisher. 800 copies were made available, and names were drawn from those who mailed their info in. Some copies of the game were also given away as prizes by PC Engine Gekken and Marakatsu magazines.

Darius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown).

Super Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen. Features new bosses, as well as a "boss rush" mode.</desc>

		<desc>Horizontal shoot 'em up for the PC Engine. The player, as cyber-diver Syd, must fly his hoverbike through the future city of Kabukicho to rescue his partner Deva from the corrupt police.

Overview
Download is a horizontal shoot 'em up set in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which the main character, Syd, is haunted by memories of his friend Ohala falling to a cybernetic menace. Meanwhile, he receives a call from his contact/partner Deva and must rush to her rescue when she is abducted by the Kabukicho police force. The game's story is depicted in a series of animated vignettes before each stage, similar to Ninja Gaiden. Beginning with the mean streets of Kabukicho, Syd will eventually jack into the internet and fights in a similar manner through cyberspace.

Download is perhaps best known for its profanity-laden game over messages. It was followed by a PC Engine CD sequel the following year: Download 2.

Gameplay
Syd's hoverbike has variable loadouts that the player can assign at the start of each level. These weapons can be upgraded further by finding power-ups within the level. The chief weapon, which can be fired infinitely, include a focused laser weapon and a scattered beam shot: the former is best for bosses and stronger foes, while the latter can quickly eliminate large crowds of weaker enemies. The player will often need to play each level a few times to determine the best loadout.

The player can also select between three sub-weapons: chaser missiles, which home in on foes; crusher, which absorbs shots and causes explosions; and barrier, which stops shots for a short time. Each sub-weapon has a finite number of uses which can be replenished by finding the right power-ups.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Egg!</name>
		<desc>A platformer where the player controls a small girl with an egg in her backpack, which can turn into a dragon.

Dragon Egg (sometimes styled Dragon Egg!) is a 2D side-scrolling platformer set in a fantasy world. The protagonist is a young girl who wields a dragon egg as a weapon. As she collects fire orbs, the dragon egg hatches into a baby dragon, and then subsequently grows further as more fire orbs are collected. As the dragon grows, the effective attack range of the protagonist increases, making the game easier. However, the dragon will revert by one stage if the player character dies.

The game also has a currency system and stores, which can provide additional fire orb power-ups and other useful tools, like health restoration and barriers, if the player acquires enough funds before entering.

The game was released exclusively for the PC Engine. However, as an action game, it doesn't include a lot of Japanese text and can be easily played by those not fluent with the language.</desc>

		<desc>A vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up that configures its difficulty to match the skill of the player.

Final Blaster is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up for the PC Engine. The player is part of squadron of fighters sent to save the world from an alien invasion. Final Blaster hosts a number of features that are distinct to the game: the first is a charge shot that resembles a phoenix and is the only form of projectile that can destroy certain larger enemies. The second is that the game configures its difficulty depending on how many power-ups the player has when finishing a level, or how often they've been destroyed.

The game was unique to the PC Engine and did not see an international release outside of Japan. It came out on the same day as W Ring: The Double Rings, another shoot 'em up exclusive to the Japanese PC Engine.</desc>

There is everything in this game that tennis is about. Smashes, stop balls, volleys, back and forehand spins or lobs. At the top of it all, you can play it in every thinkable player combination (training, tournament, 1-4 players). By the way: in addition, its one of the best multiplayer games ever.</desc>

As Earth is attacked by the alien war machines, it is revealed that the culprits are identified as the Gader'el, a race of large bio-mechanic creatures, who have the ability to freely manipulate space and time; after conquering the future Earth in the 25th century, the Gader'el decided to ensure their influence on mankind by traveling back in time to the 23rd century, conquering that time and then going further into Earth's past.
As the armed forces of every country on Earth combats the Gader'el, each scientific academy collaborates on making a weapon capable of destroying the Gader'el's strongest weapons. The result is the Dryad, a single-fighter spaceship capable of wielding several types of futuristic weapons. The Dryad's flight path and mission is to warp into the Future Zone in order to reach the Gader'el headquarters and destroy their leader.</desc>

		<name>Gaia no Monshou</name>
		<desc>Gaia no Monshō (also known as the 'Crest of Gaia') is a fantasy round-based strategy game by NCS and conversion of a game originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in 1987. The Light and Dark forces are engaged in a fierce war and Böser, leader of the Dark Army, is now ready to capture the Rall Tower, source of the world's energy. Sieghart, leader of the Light army, is the only one who stands between the evil Böser and the complete decimation of the kingdom. Gaia no Monshō is a turn-based strategy game at heart - the player moves troops around a battlefield and attacks nearby enemy units. An Auto Battle mode is also available and gives the option to let the AI figure out of the player's next move. The game offers several play modes - the first one (Scenario Mode) gives the player the chance to jump straight into battle using predefined troops. The second (Construction Mode) allows him to build his own army using unit points. The last one (Campaign Mode) conveys story plot elements and starts in the siege town of Dirl, where king Sieghart battles the fierce Böser. This mode requires more complex strategy and the player must assemble his own troops using unit points and units lost in battle don't come back during the campaign. Unlike the other two modes, it offers a password system to save the player's progress through the game.</desc>

		<name>Genji Tsuushin Agedama</name>
		<desc>Agedama Genji is a 4th grader boy in elementary school, and a hero on the training from 'Hero Planet.' Though the cheerful kid is no one special in appearance, he can transforms into a superhero called "Agedaman" by combining himself with his computer friend called Wapuro. He believes in Kiai power and he tries to handle all the problems that he encounters with that, so his father decided to let him go training on the earth accompanied by only Wapuro on summer vacation. After his arrival to Morisoba city, where an enormously wealthy clan rules arbitrarily, he joined East-Morisoba elementary school, then met a diva girl of the clan named Rei Kuki who has an ambition to conquer the world and, as a first step, attacks the city with a variety of chimera monsters that she and her grandfather create with the Monster-Cooker, which the rich old man invented. When they plot to attack the city she transforms into a super-villainess called "Onyomiko". The battles of Agedaman and Onyomiko began!</desc>

		<name>Gomola Speed</name>
		<desc>A game of reflexes and strategy inspired by the classic Arcade game Snake.

Gomola Speed is a top-down action game in which the player increases the size of their snake-like protagonist by collecting and uniting the various segments moving around the level. When long enough, the player character can wrap themselves around stunned enemies - the player can drop bombs that will momentarily stagger any enemy caught in the blast - and valuable food in order to acquire them. Once all the food has been collected, the exit opens somewhere in the level and the player can progress. Progressive stages have different gimmicks and solutions to completing them.

The game was developed by UPL and released exclusively to the PC Engine in Japan.</desc>

		<desc>Hanii on the Road (aka Hany on the Road or Honey on the Road) is a side scrolling action game by Face. After Hanii's exploits in Hanii in the Sky, the little Haniwa clay doll is back on a new mission. This time around, our cute friend must free the world from all the demons and other evil creatures that escaped from the Gods' realm. But this time around he's not flying or shooting balls of energy - instead, he must run along a roadway divided into four lanes, each moving at different speeds. And things are just not as easy as it may sound - Hanii has to jump over various enemies and try not to fall into deep holes dug into the ground, without forgetting the occasional change in scrolling direction and the myriad of other exciting, and often lethal, effects. A time limit also urges him to hurry and to quickly reach the end of each stage. Every little helps, and tiny wood signs scattered around every road tell Hany how far the next exit is. Additionally, special items can be collected along the way, such as Blue jars giving Hanii extra lives (twenty five of them need to be collected though), Mystery Jars giving from 100 to 1000 points, Extra Lives, Time Clocks, Rockets, Trampolines and other unique and often bizarre super powers (he can turn into a race-car or an almighty warrior in some stages!). Hanii on the Road consists of many levels and features a non-linear structure with interconnected paths to follow, as well as bosses. The game also offers a two simultaneous player mode where Lemon, a yellow version of Hanii, comes to the rescue.</desc>

		<desc>Remember Tetris? The way those cubes kept coming at you? That was tricky enough, but what if they were half a dozen different hats instead? Derbies, baseball caps, cowboy hats, wizard hats, top hats and crowns? Well, that's the whole idea behind Hatris. The hats keep coming at you two at a time. All you have to do is stack them up five at a time and - poof - they're history. It sounds perfectly simple. Until you get into it. Then you'll wish you had six heads instead of one. Because this is the latest game from Alexey Pajitnov, the designer of Tetris, and his partner Vladimir Pokhilko. And anyone who could turn geometry into a contact sport is a force to be reckoned with. And this time they really want you to use your head. If you don't, you'll look pretty strange with that pile of hats on it!</desc>

		<name>Image Fight</name>
		<desc>Image Fight is an intense vertical shooter by Irem and is the conversion of their own arcade game released back in 1988. The player takes control of the OF-1, a powerful Orbit Fighter ship codenamed Daidalos on a mission to annihilate the Moon defense system which suddenly went out of control. The rather unique feature of Image Fight is the "simulation mode" (called 'Image Fight') that precedes the "real battle" (called 'Real Fight'). The game counts a grand total of eight zones - the first five are Combat Training Stages and happen in a virtual space where the player must at least achieve a whooping 90% destruction ratio. If successful, the Real Combat reveals itself and the player gets launched in outer space and fly through three more stages. Just like with any traditional shooter, the ship can be upgraded by collecting flying capsules. They come in two flavors - the first are colored pods (blue and red) which hang around the ship and either fire straight ahead or in the opposite direction the fighter is facing. Those pods can also be thrown at the enemies to inflict more damage. The other kind are various devices that attach at the front of the ship and greatly improve its fire power - they include Bubble lasers, Homing Lasers, V Lasers or the powerful Drill Laser. Sadly, only one can be collected at the same time and the only way to dispose of them is to get hit. Finally, the speed of the ship can be adjusted anytime during the game and the resulting blast of energy can even be used to damage enemy ships.</desc>

		<desc>A top-down driving game where the player must deliver various packages around town, upgrading their moped as they complete jobs. The game has a subversive sense of humour.

Kattobi! Takuhai-kun ("Fury! Delivery Boy") is a top-down action/driving game from Advance Communications Company and Tonkin House. The player is a delivery boy who must make a series of increasingly surreal deliveries across town, occasionally leaving the country and getting into trouble with drug trafficking. As the player complete jobs, they can use their earnings to buy better two-wheeled delivery vehicles, upgrading from a pedal bike to a moped to a state-of-the-art motorcycle. Destroying their vehicle (by losing a life) drops them back down to the regular pedal bike.

The game was released exclusively in Japan on the PC Engine. It is perhaps best known to western audiences for its appearance on an episode of the Japanese video game TV show GameCenter CX.</desc>

		<desc>You're an elite chopper jockey, ready to launch your Cobra against the coastal defenses of an evil superpower. They've got the numbers. You've got the might and the fight! You're Twin Cobra, the most awesome attack weapon in the skies!
Bank in low over the desert and start pounding. The enemy's all over you! Knock out swarms of attack copters while you avoid smoking sheets of ground fire! Blast battalions of tanks into smoking craters.
Then it's open ocean warfare! Machinegun a fiery trail through wave after wave of heavily armed gunboats. Bomb huge battleships and destroyers. Strafe gigantic armored carriers as they pour on the firepower.
The longer you live, the tougher you get. Your weapons fire faster and harder. But the hostiles keep coming! See how much you can make the ground grunts scream! It's your war now.

Kyuukyoku Tiger  is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up and is the sequel to Tiger-Heli which continues the tradition to include the word Tiger in the title of each game in the series. Subsequent Japan-only sequels would use the same title, which roughly translates as "Ultimate Tiger".

The helicopter comes equipped with a default forward-firing weapon that is able to hit both air and ground targets, as well as a finite supply of bombs which hit enemies in a wide radius for massive amounts of damage. The player can find power-ups by shooting down the relatively sturdy Chinook enemy choppers, which initially allow the player to upgrade their standard gun to include more shots, but will eventually allow them to pick up weapons that can fire in different patterns. These include a four-way shot that fires in the four cardinal directions and a spread shot that fires forwards and outwards in a cone. The player can also find additional bombs by destroying this type of enemy.

At the end of each stage, and occasionally partway through, is a boss. These take considerably more damage than regular enemies and can fire a lot more projectiles as well.</desc>

		<name>Legend of Hero Tonma</name>
		<desc>An Irem Arcade side-scrolling platformer, featuring the titular hero Tonma. His main weapon is a fireball that can be upgraded multiple times.

Legend of Hero Tonma is a 1989 Irem Arcade platformer, known for its difficulty, brightly colored graphics and its rarity in the US. The game was converted to the TurboGrafx-16 in 1993 (based on the 1991 PC Engine version) making it one of the last games to be released for the system in the US.

The game is graphically similar to Wonder Boy, but is also structured similarly to Ghouls n' Ghosts. The player must pass through areas filled with enemies, trying to survive long enough to upgrade their fireballs to the point where it becomes far easier to cope.

Legend of Hero Tonma is an action game that puts players in control of the magic-user Tonma, whose role – as was typical for game heroes of the day – is to travel to another world and save the princess. Fight your way through seven stages using Tonma’s jump ability and shot power. Collect power-ups and barriers to grow in strength and pummel your enemies. Bring that strength to the end of each stage to face off against and defeat the menacing bosses that aim to keep you from the princess.</desc>

		<name>Maison Ikkoku</name>
		<desc>Maison Ikkoku (めぞん一刻?) is a graphical text-adventure game developed by Micro Cabin and published on multiple popular Japanese home computer systems towards the end of 1986. It was ported to the Famicom by Bothtec in 1988. Micro Cabin then ported the game one final time to the PC Engine in 1989. The game is based on the popular manga and anime series of the same name, Maison Ikkoku.

The story is a bitter-sweet comedic romance involving a group of madcap people who live in a boarding house in 1980s Tokyo. The story focuses primarily on the gradual developing relationships between Yusaku Godai, a poor student down on his luck, and Kyoko Otonashi, a young, recently-widowed boarding house manager.

In the game, you take the role of Godai performing various missions that deal with the storyline of Maison Ikkoku. You have to avoid Yotsuya's pranks, save money to throw a party, proclaim your love for Kyoko and other things. The action takes place all over Tokeizaka and not just the boarding house. Players can visit Soichiro's grave, Chachamaru, the train station and many other familiar locales.</desc>

		<desc>AKA: 魔境伝説. The jungles surrounding the village of Minofu are under the thumb of the evil Jagu cult who require a blood sacrifice. A beautiful young woman named Flare has been selected as this season’s offering, however her boyfriend Gogan will not stand for it. Equipped with the legendary axe ‘Sting’, he braves the six zones of Jagu’s territory to defeat the cult and save his love.

Throughout the zones are breakable Jagu idols which drop various sized gems for points leading to extra lives, health revitalizing orbs of differing strength, crown-like crystal containers, and wing icons. Four crystal containers can be earned which charge the destructive power of Sting’s strike, while up to two wings can be collected increasing the speed of subsequent strikes.

Each time you use the axe, the power meter drains completely then recharges as long as you don’t continue to swing. The added strategy of - is it better to dodge and charge the axe for a crushing blow, or is it better to hack away as fast as possible – sets this game apart from most other hack-n-slashers. When you die, one level of speed and axe power is taken away and you must re-find an icon to get it back. The game doesn’t lock you to only scrolling right, so there are times where you can backtrack to find items.

		<desc>A cyberpunk multi-directional shoot 'em up for the PC Engine.

Metal Stoker is a top-down, multi-directional shoot 'em up for the PC Engine, developed and published by Face (possibly through their subsidiary brand Sankindo). The game features the subtitle "Neo Hardboiled Shooting".

The goal of the game is to explore each stage, fight a boss and move onto the next. Some stages are comprised of several linear enclosed areas that require that the player clear the room of enemies before they can proceed, while others are more open and let the player scroll in multiple directions while seeking out their foes. The story is sparse, and concerns the player's testing out of a new Custom CS-05 tank through a series of simulations.

The game was released exclusively for the PC Engine. It has yet to be rereleased in any capacity.</desc>

		<desc>A sequel to Hudson's RPG featuring Momotarou: the Peach Boy of Japanese folklore. The oni are cooking up another scheme and it's up to Momotarou and his companions to travel the world and stop them.

Momotarou Densetsu II ("Peachboy Legend II") is an RPG for the PC Engine of the standard turn-based Dragon Quest mold. It is the second proper game in Hudson's Momotarou Densetsu series - which would later spawn the Momotarou Dentetsu series of railroad virtual board games - and features numerous other figures from Japanese mythology.

The general structure of the game has Momotarou cross the world with his animal NPC companions, solving the problems of each new town or village he comes across. Upon successfully resolving their demon problem, the town thanks him with elaborate celebrations. Momotarou can eventually pick up a large number of allies, who all follow behind him on the world map. Rather than force the player to locate each new location, they can send their animal companions to scout ahead to eliminate the amount of wandering around.</desc>

Momotarou Densetsu Turbo ("Peach Boy Legend Turbo") is the second game in the Momotarou Densetsu franchise, though is effectively a revamp of the first game released for the Famicom. The game displays Momotarou's origins as a baby born of a giant peach that a kindly couple found floating down a river, and covers how he met his animal companions and fought the Oni on their island.

The game sets up the sequel, Momotarou Densetsu II, which was released exclusively for the PC Engine a few months later.</desc>

		<desc>A platformer starring Hudson Soft's take on the famous Momotaro of Japanese folklore. The same concept would later be seen in the Momotaro Thunderbolt games for Game Boy.

Momotaro Katsugeki ("Momotaro Action Movie") is a side-scrolling action-platformer from Hudson that uses their Momotaro character who is better known as the star of the Momotaro Dentetsu and Momotaro Densetsu series. It is a PC Engine exclusive and never saw international releases.

Momotaro Katsugeki seems influenced by and plays similarly to Westone's Wonder Boy in Monster Land and the sequels that followed: the goal is to move across a set of 2D stages, and the player can talk to NPCs for hints and to purchase better equipment with the money they find. There is also a world map that links the various stages together.

The concept of a 2D side-scrolling action game featuring Momotaro would be further explored by Hudson with the two Game Boy Momotaro Dengeki/Thunderbolt games.</desc>

		<desc>Moto Roader is a futuristic racing game that allows up to five players to compete against each other. Players use the cash earned when they win a race to power up their machine. Not only can they change the "tire" and "body" of their vehicles, but they also can add "special" parts. Jump over tall obstacles with a "hopper" and blast past rivals at incredible speeds with "nitro." What multiplayer game would be complete without attack items? Use a forward-launching "grenade" or a backward-dropping "bomber" to blow up and knock away rivals. Outmaneuver rivals in all eight heats to become the champion.</desc>

		<desc>Being a one-man army is a difficult business - just ask that bloke Rambo. But you have taken on the hard task of mowing down whole platoons of enemy forces single handed, all to rescue hostages from a rather nasty concentration camp. Choosing from one of four stages, you have a first person view of the action and have to carefully aim your on-screen crosshair to take out the bad guys - but don't get too trigger happy, as there are many civilians and innocents who have chosen just this moment to go for a stroll in the middle of a raging firefight. You have limited ammunition, which can be replenished by shooting the spare clips lying around (which are also dropped from objects such as coconuts and birds), and also a small supply of extra powerful rockets which make short work of armoured vehicles or helicopters that have you in their sights. Occasionally you will see a pile of dynamite that serves as a smart bomb, and a nice energy drink which increases your health slightly - which is essential as it does not recover between levels.

		<desc>Konami's imaginative parody on the Gradius series. It plays just like Gradius, with the same power-up system, but features a far more bizarre and imaginative series of levels and characters.
This game was released in Japan for the PC Engine and is a port of the Arcade original with a couple of differences: it doesn't have the arcade Stages 5 and 8, but features a stage titled SPECIAL and a new introduction that features several strange-looking Japanese characters. This is in contrast to the arcade intro, which chronicles the Gradius legacy up until the time of release.</desc>

		<desc>Ever felt underpowered and lacking in omnipotence? Well now is your chance to live the dream in Populous, Bullfrog's seminal god game. Domination is the aim here - you control a community of cute little guys and must build a population greater than your computer controlled rival. Starting with a house or two, you are at first limited to raising and lowering the ground - the flatter the ground around a domicile, the more advanced it becomes, up to the level of a sturdy fort. But this is not the extent of your power. More houses mean more people, and more people means the higher your little arrow creeps along your power bar, opening up such furious skills to inflict on your opponent like floods, swamps and volcanoes that disrupt the landscape and any city planning therein. Once you feel you have sufficiently dominated the opposition (the display on the top right conveniently gives you a visual guide here) then you release armageddon - all followers gather together and duke it out until there is only one. Depending on your score, you then move forward any number of levels which include diverse scenery such as grasslands, desert, snow and volcanic rock.</desc>

		<name>Shiryou Sensen</name>
		<desc>Shiryō Sensen War of the Dead is a post apocalyptic and dark Role Playing/Action game by Victor Musical Industries. Due to a series of mysterious events, the town of Chany's Hill has been cut off from the rest of the world. People have suddenly gone missing and cannibalistic monsters now roam the land, killing all who cross their path. The protagonist of the game is Laila Arufon, the youngest female member of the S-SWAT (Supernatural and Special Weapon Attack Team). She was born in the small town and has developped strange psychic abilities. Her Psychic Seal ("PS") and Mind Force ("MF") powers allow her to increase any weapon destruction power but also to increase her defense capability greatly. Her mission is twofold - she must investigate the mysterious and supernatural incident in Chaneys Hill and to rescue all the remaining survivors she can find and lead them to the town's church. Laila comes equipped with a combat knife and a Hand Gun (SIG/SAUER P226) - additional weapons appear later in the game including the Assault Rifle (STYER AUG), Grenade launcher (HK MZP1), Flamethrower (M2A1-7), Bazooka (M72A2) and so forth. Although most of the game uses a traditional top-down view, battles quickly drop the game into side-scrolling action phases. There, Laila fights hordes of monsters to gain experience (blue orbs), life (reb orbs), MF points (green orbs) or ammunitions (pink cases). She can also escape at anytime as long as she can reach the edge of the fighting area. The combat items are complemented by more conventional inventory items such as medic packs, psychic pills, keys and so forth. Player's progression is saved through a long password system.</desc>

		<desc>Make your way through a dungeon-like space station and defeat the prowling monsters in this real-time first-person shooter. You're a member of the elite Debuggers, a group of warriors who are jacks-of- all-trades. Assigned to inspect an unmanned space station, you have exactly 100 minutes to get in, destroy the monsters lurking in each block, make your way to the lowest level and deactivate the automatic detonator placed there. With each monster that slips by you, the core block becomes harder to survive in, so speed is key in preserving the facility and each separate block. Experience the thrill of survival as the timer ticks away and you uncover the truth of the events that occurred.</desc>

		<desc>Vertical sci-fi shoot ‘em up from the Hudson stable. Soldier Blade sticks to the tried and tested formula of Hudson’s previous games in the 'series', while throwing in some extra graphical effects. This time, the power up system involves collecting coloured pods - you can have three pods in stock at any one time, and the colour of the 'active' pod determines your weapon style. You also have the choice of ejecting a pod at any time, which results in a weapon-specific super attack.</desc>

		<name>Son Son II</name>
		<desc>This platformer sequel to Son Son was only released on the PC Engine in Japan.

Son Son 2 is the direct sequel to Son Son and features an interpretation of the Son Goku character from ancient Chinese novel Journey to the West. Unlike the first game, which played like a ground-based scrolling shoot-'em-up with several floors the character could switch between, Son Son II plays much more like a traditional platformer, specifically Wonder Boy and even more overtly Capcom's earlier arcade game Black Tiger. Son Son attacks with his extendable staff (based on Sun Wukong's Ruyi Jingu Bang weapon) and can defeat enemies to earn coins, which can be spent on upgrades and health refills. The player also needs to find a key on each stage before they can reach the boss.

The goal of the game is to rescue the other members of his party: Xuanzang (Tripitaka), Pigsy and Sandy. They are kidnapped during the opening cutscene by the final boss, who is depicted as a mysterious silhouette.

Son Son II is also one of the earliest Capcom games to use Zenny, their trademark fictional currency.</desc>

		<name>Stratego</name>
		<desc>A video game adaptation of the famous strategic board game. Find the opponent's flag, and watch out for that spy.

Overview:
Stratego is a board game adaptation that was originally published by Accolade for various home computers in 1990. The game was also localized for a Japanese audience with the PC Engine release, which was published by Victor Entertainment in 1992.

The game closely follows the rules of the classic Stratego board game as conceived by creators Jumbo, which was later licensed by Milton Bradley for North America. The game also offers various different modes, including a campaign mode which involves consecutive maps, as well as the option to change the visual design for the board and the pieces.

Gameplay:
The standard rules of Stratego are as follows-
The player must start the game by placing all forty units in the four rows on their side of the board.
The player can move any of the numbered units or the Spy (S) unit one space. The Flag (F) and Bombs (B) cannot be moved.
No two units can occupy the same space. If an enemy unit and a player's unit meet, the one with the highest number (which correlates to a lower rank) is removed. The winning unit then moves into the empty space. If they have the same number, both are removed.
If a unit touches the enemy's flag, they win the game.
There are special rules governing a few of the units:

The Spy unit will be removed if attacked by anyone. However, they are the only unit that can defeat the highest ranked unit - the Marshall, or #1. They can only do so if they are the attacker, not the defender.
If any unit touches a Bomb, they are removed from the board. The Bomb does not move into the empty space.
The Miner (#8) is the only unit that can destroy a Bomb.
The Scout (#9) can move any number of spaces horizontally and vertically.</desc>

		<desc>Tatsujin is a vertical shooter by Taito and conversion of Toaplan arcade game originally released in 1988. The evil Gidans are about to invade the Borogo system, their armada of giant asteroids are approaching and they have to be stopped. The player must infiltrate and destroy no less than five large enemy facilities and take down swarms of alien ships and all kind of ground units. The space fighter comes equipped with a default Vulcan gun (Power shots) and two more weapons are available for the taking - the blue lock-on lasers (Thunder Laser) and green blasts of energy (Tatsujin Beam). The only way to increase the active weapon's firepower is to collect Power Boosters special flying pods leave behind. Although five boosters are necessary to trigger a power-up upgrade and boost up the strength of the current weapon, special red flashing power icons bring it up to maximum power in no time. Each weapon can be powered up to three times for maximum collateral damage and smart bombs in the shape of monstrous skull-faced energy blasts can be unleashed to kill most enemies on screen. Finally, speed boosters are strategically placed throughout the game to help the player dodge enemy fire more efficiently.</desc>

		<name>Tatsunoko Fighter</name>
		<desc>Tatsu no Ko fighter (also known as Dragon Fighter) is a simple platform game published by Tonkin House. It follows the adventures of a young farmer as he travels across a country full of dangers. He carries around a long stick which he slyly uses to take down his enemies. He has a few more tricks up his sleeves - thanks to his magic book (press 'Run' and select a weapon by pressing 'up' and 'down'), he can also shoot blasts of energy from it. However, this technique depletes some of his magic energy which he has to refill periodically. But his ultimate weapon is the ability to turn into a powerful topless fighter - this technique is however only available for the toughest boss encounters located at the end of each area. In this form, our hero can use a powerful chain-whip (which consumes magic energy) to land more punishing blows than his bare fists. Throughout the game, various enemies drop magic orbs when defeated which range from power-ups (red P), increase max-life (green P), increase magic bar (green M), freeze time clocks, bombs, life potions and so forth. Each defeated enemy also drop money that can later be used to purchase life and magic from town people located at the end of each area. This is also where the stick can be later upgraded into a more lethal spear. Finally, infinite continues are available.</desc>

		<name>Violent Soldier</name>
		<desc>Sinistron, released as Violent Soldier in Japan, is a side-scrolling, ship based shooter that was released for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1991.

The game is notable, among other things, for the adjustable armored jaws of the player's spacecraft. Opening the invincible jaws of the ship increases the spread of the player's shots but exposes the vulnerable cockpit. Obtaining one weapon upgrade allows the ship's jaws to be set half-way open (a 3-shot spread) or closed (with increased damage), and a second upgrade allows them to be closed, half open, or fully open (a 5 shot spread).

Five power-ups exist in the game. The Vulcan flame cannon, crystal-pulse laser, and CHAOS (homing) missiles are weapon upgrades. There are also speed upgrades and plasma droids, invincible pods which will flank the ship. The plasma droids can absorb enemy pellets and will even damage enemies they come into contact with.

The ship's charge-up attack releases a circular wave of force that will damage all enemies in a radius around the ship.

Sinistron has six stages of quickly increasing difficulty. The last two stages take place inside the Sinistron creature itself. The stages are:

Mechanical Stage
Gas Tunnel Stage
Biological Stage
Deep Space Stage
Organs Stage
Cerebral Cortex Stage</desc>

		<path>./Volfied (Japan).cue</path>
		<name>Volfied</name>
		<desc>The third game in Taito's QIX series, Volfied loses the geometric abstraction of previous games in favor of a more sci-fi look.

Overview:
Volfied is an Arcade title released by Taito in 1989 as the sequel to QIX II. As well as ports for the PC Engine, Genesis and the home computers Atari ST, Amiga and PC, Volfied was also released on the 2005 PS2 compilation Taito Legends and as a Java mobile game in Europe in 2007.

On home consoles in North America, it was marketed under the more familiar QIX brand. It was known as The Jintori ~Volfied 1500 (Japan) and Neo QIX (US) for its PlayStation port, which was part of the Simple budget series. For its North American Sega Genesis release, it was known as Ultimate QIX.

Gameplay:
As with QIX, the goal is to carve out pieces of the playing field by drawing a box that encapsulates a certain percentage of the screen. While drawing these boxes, the player's vehicle is vulnerable to the various enemy craft patrolling the playing field. Areas within the drawn squares turn inert and are inaccessible by enemies. Once the player turns enough of the playing field inert, which is a minimum of 80% for Volfied (up from the 70% needed for QIX), the level is complete and the player earns a bonus based on how far over the minimum percentage amount they managed to achieve. Each screen has one large enemy that cannot be defeated: if the player cuts the field in half with one maneuver, the "active" playing field will be whichever side holds the large enemy. Smaller enemies, however, will be destroyed if they are inside the inert area.

Volfied introduces small bonus pods that, once enveloped in a box, confer bonuses and power-ups to the player. The type of power-up they earn is based on the letter on the power-up.</desc>

Winning Shot is a golf game for the PC Engine/Turbogfrafx-16 and was the very first game based on the sport to be released for the system. Up to four human players can play, though because of the nature of golf, each player takes alternating turns depending on their distance from the hole. The game has many similar features to golf games of this era - the player can select which club to use, whether or not to hit the ball at a slight angle to adjust its trajectory and which direction to hit the ball towards, before hitting the requisite power gauge at the right point to send the ball flying as close to the hole as possible.</desc>

		<name>Wonder Momo</name>
		<desc>An action game presented as "hero show" developed by Namco.

Overview:
Wonder Momo is an action game starring a girl named Momo. The game is actually a tokusatsu "hero show", I.E. a stage show with people in costume acting as heroes and villains; such tokusatsu shows were once a popular form of entertainment for children in Japan and generally would feature well-known heroes and villains, such as characters from Kamen Rider. However, based on the appearance of the audience, the "Wonder Momo" show seems to be aimed at a slightly different audience. It is being presented at "Namco Theater".

In the game's storyline, Momo is a heroine from space who is fighting the evil "Phantom Warudemon Army" (Kaijin Gundan Warudemon" / 怪人軍団ワルデモン).

Gameplay:
The player controls Momo with a traditional 8 way joystick or D-pad, in the case of the home ports. Momo can jump and attack with the respective buttons; she can also high jump by holding up and jump and has several attacks at her disposal. Each stage consists of a backdrop against which Momo will fight a variety of enemies; If the player wanders far enough to either the left of right, they will encounter a curtain. After enough enemies are defeated a boss will appear. A whirlwind will also appear at various points; if Momo makes contact with the tornado, she will turn in to Wonder Momo!</desc>

		<name>Youkai Douchuuki</name>
		<desc>The player controls a boy named Tarosuke, who travels through "Jigoku" (the Japanese concept of Hell) fighting off "yokai" (mythical Japanese monsters) on his way to his final fate, as determined by Buddha. He destroys his enemies by firing small Ki bullets, which can be charged to increase their power; however, if overcharged, he is left unable to move or fight for a few seconds. During boss battles, Tarosuke kneels at a shrine to Buddha and prays, summoning "Monmotaro" (not to be confused with "Momotarō"), a spirit which floats in the air and drops energy balls on the boss and any lackeys he has. Once the boss is defeated, Tarosuke goes to the next stage.

Like Clovis from Dragon Buster, Taira no Kagekiyo from Genpei Tōma Den, and Momo Chan from Wonder Momo, Tarosuke has a life bar (labeled as "POWER") but only one life; if the meter is empty, the game is over (unless he has a certain item). There are no scoring systems present, but the game utilizes currency (only referred to as "MONEY") which is used to buy items, among other things.

There are five stages: Jigoku Iriguchi (Gateway to Hell), Kugyou no Michi (Path of Penance), Yuukai (Ghost Sea), Sabaki no Tani (Valley of Judgment) and Rinnekai (Land of Transmigration). There are multiple paths which can be taken in many stages, which may influence which of the five endings the player gets. One of the paths leads the player to a fairly racy dance hall show, after which he is given a box. If he opens the box, he might get 10,000 in money, or might be turned into an old man until he buys a particular item in a shop (this is based on the tale of Urashima Tarō). There are five different endings depending on what Tarosuke did in the game:

    He goes to Hell.
    He goes to Hungry Ghoul World.
    He goes to Beast World.
    He returns to Human World.
    He goes to Heaven.</desc>

		<name>Adventure Island</name>
		<desc>Life as a roaming adventurer is never easy. One minute you're shoving several feet of cold steel between the gaping jaws of some evil robot dragon, and the next thing you know, you've been transformed into a fire breathing lizard man. Such is the problem that you first encounter at the beginning of Adventure Island, Hudson Soft's conversion of the Master System game 'Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'. Taking more of its influence from the second game in the Wonder Boy series than the first, Adventure Island has a more balanced structure and more exploratory gameplay.

The main game is centred around a small village which acts as a sort of 'hub' to the surrounding levels. Each of these levels are gradually accessed over time with the acquisition of keys or new transformations. As the game progresses, you will find yourself transforming into five different creatures, which can (and need to) be switched between in special rooms. The lizard is the basic transformation and does little more than breathe fire at any passing fauna. Mouse man is a tiny little critter and aside from being able to fit under small obstacles, he can also run up and around special chequered walls and ceilings. Next up is a green amphibian that gives you the power to swim around freely, followed by a tiger man who swings his sword around in a wide arc, allowing you to break blocks above and below. Finally, there is the bird transformation which lets you fly around by repeatedly tapping the jump button.

As you progress, your quest will take you over many types of terrain from jungle to desert to the inside of a giant pyramid - but to help you out there is a password/backup save feature in a church in the main village. As you viciously hack up the cute little inhabitants of the island, you find that they considerately drop money and helpful items for you. The money is used in shops to upgrade your armour, or buy healing at the hospital, while the other items are special weapons that can be set from the pause menu. These include homing fireballs, ground based mini whirlwinds and arrows that shoot directly upwards (and are a blessing when you are trying to get rid of flame-dropping clouds).</desc>

Every level ends with a boss and some section speed up the gameplay, offering fast obstacle courses both horizontally and vertically scrolling. Flying orange pods release many power-ups at once, enhancing the ships with new or more powerful lasers, wing men and shields. The player can also hold the fire key to charge a blast that removes all enemy bullets from the screen and deals damage to all enemies. With an unforgiving difficulty, every hit is fatal, but the game can be continued from any points as long as there are lives and credits left.

		<name>After Burner II</name>
		<desc>One of Sega's big arcade hits using their 'super scaler' technology, it was a bold move to try and convert this to any home machine. After Burner II is, quite simply, one of the most mindless shooters that you're ever likely to play: simply fly your F-14 into the screen, dodging missiles like crazy and letting all hell loose with your vulcan cannon. There is precious little strategy - even less than Space Harrier, and often luck plays more of a part than skill. The action is split up by the occasional bonus stage - a run through a canyon blowing up anything that dares to exist in front of you. Fuelling planes and landing strips also make a regular appearance.</desc>

		<name>Aoi Blink</name>
		<desc>Based on a TV anime series (from the grandfather of manga Osamu Tezuka), Blue Blink is a cute platformer that manages to find its place among the crowd. The game is divided up into different areas, each represented by a map screen. Within these areas, you can choose your route to the end (by exiting levels at certain points). Throughout each area you have to find a 'master key' allowing you access to the boss - this can be hard to locate at times and requires lots of shooting at blank areas of screen just in case.

Control of your character is original - on each stage you have three characters which you can choose between, with the CPU controlled ones following behind you like some bizarre congo line. The characters are preset and vary from stage to stage, and each one has different attributes. For example, some have very high jumping ability, whereas others are poor at jumping but have spread-shot weapons. Once you have found the master key and reached the final level in the area, you are entered into a boss battle, where you sit astride the titular donkey and attempt to fight your way to the next area.</desc>

		<name>Atomic Robo-Kid Special</name>
		<desc>More of an explorative shooter than the standard blasting affairs, Atomic Robo-Kid Special takes all the elements from the arcade version and jiggles around with them a bit for the PC Engine. The control method takes a little getting used to - pressing button I selects from one of four weapons collected along the way, whereas holding down button I will lock you to the direction you are facing, making backing-away and firing easier. It can be fiddly at first, but it's essential that you master it.

The four weapons available are variable in quality. The forward shot and diagonal shot are both only useful when you've lost the other weapons, as the missile and full-fire are the ones that you will utilise most often. The missile is particularly useful as in some levels you are required to blast away areas of wall to progress. Levels are varied - some are horizontal, some are more like mazes and there are also two types of boss area: one with a small enemy over the opposite side of the screen protected by a barrier you have to destroy, and another with a huge mechanical monster that follows you relentlessly around an arena.</desc>

You can pretty much guess how it works - there's a World GP mode where you have to compete in a variety of races in order and a Travel mode that let's you pick a track of your choice. Also to consider is the gubbins that make up your bike, such as tyres, engine, brakes etc as these have an effect depending on the type of course and the weather conditions. Races are started with a qualifying lap that lets you get the feel of the track, followed by the race proper. You are then placed and can hopefully move on to the next country.</desc>

Also to consider is the gubbins that make up your bike, such as tyres, engine, brakes etc as these have an effect depending on the type of course and the weather conditions. Races are started with a qualifying lap that lets you get the feel of the track, followed by the race proper. You are then placed and can hopefully move on to the next country.</desc>

		<desc>The Engine is hardly lacking in shooters, so to be successful, you have to stand out from the crowd. Barunba tries to add a hint of originality in its own subtle way. You control what is basically a floating globe (complete with little man inside) that has a weapons ring around it - this ring can be rotated right around the ship giving a fully controllable direction of fire, something obviously useful for those pesky critters approaching from behind. From the start, you are equipped with several different types of weapon, each of which can be temporarily boosted by collecting items that are dropped by exploding enemies. The levels are auto-scroll, moving around in all directions and contain mid-level as well as end-of-level bosses. Your ship has an energy bar, located at the bottom left of the screen, and once it is depleted it's 'Game Over'.</desc>

		<name>Battle Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>Once an ancient arcade game, and with a previous version on the PC Engine by Pack In Video, Hudson Soft have taken the addictive gameplay of Lode Runner and given the graphics a complete face lift. The puzzle-based action in Lode Runner is simple: You are presented with a side-view platforms-and-ladders based level and you have to collect all the gold and escape without getting caught by the baddies. To defend yourself, you can dig holes in the ground, either to the left or to the right, and enemies stumbling upon them will fall down and be trapped. If you time it right, the hole will re-fill before the enemy can climb out, forcing them to respawn elsewhere in the level. If you prefer evasive action, make sure the coast is clear so you can escape up a ladder or across a well-placed rope, but be warned - they will follow! Once you have collected all the gold, hotfoot it to the nearest long ladder and escape out the top of the screen. In magazine previews, this was originally titled Lode Runner II.</desc>

		<name>Blodia</name>
		<desc>Puzzle games. Don't you just love 'em? Classics like Tetris, Puzzle Bobble, Klax....and then there's Blodia. The concept behind Blodia is very simple: 1-You have a screen of pipe-work. 2-There is a ball travelling down the pipe. 3-If the ball drops down a gap in the pipe you have to start again. That's it. So what this all amounts to is you frantically sliding the tiles around block-puzzle style to keep that cursed ball bearing on track. God forbid that you think the ball is moving too slowly, you can even push a button to speed the damn thing up, but you have to wonder why you would ever want to do that.

		<name>Bomberman '93</name>
		<desc>The black spaceman kidnapped Bomberman's beloved and brought her to his chambers in the castle, far beyond his reach, over the rivers, forest and mountains. Bomberman's job is to save her, battling the sea of the enemies, with only bombs at his disposal.

The range of Bomberman's bomb explosions can be upgraded with time, but if he dies, the range resets back to the minimum range and Bomberman loses his previous skills. Some updates can make Bomberman walk through the walls, increase his speed, and give him some other assets to aid him in his quest to save the woman he loves.

This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final one consisting of the boss that will have to be dealt with. Bomberman can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind him, thus evaporating the enemies, but beware: Bomberman can block himself with his own bomb, and thus become a victim of his own bomb.</desc>

		<desc>The black spaceman kidnapped Bomberman's beloved and brought her to his chambers in the castle, far beyond his reach, over the rivers, forest and mountains. Bomberman's job is to save her, battling the sea of the enemies, with only bombs at his disposal.

The range of Bomberman's bomb explosions can be upgraded with time, but if he dies, the range resets back to the minimum range and Bomberman loses his previous skills. Some updates can make Bomberman walk through the walls, increase his speed, and give him some other assets to aid him in his quest to save the woman he loves.

This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final one consisting of the boss that will have to be dealt with. Bomberman can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind him, thus evaporating the enemies, but beware: Bomberman can block himself with his own bomb, and thus become a victim of his own bomb.</desc>

		<desc>The Engine doesn't really have much in the way of pool games. In fact, this is the only one that I can think of. It looks and plays like those games you used to see in arcades and has plenty of options to choose from. Firstly you get to choose from simulation, action and technique (which lets you try out loads of trick shots). Then, you can play against other humans, your coach or try out the challenge mode that sets you up as a stowaway on a cruise liner, having to beat 14 opponents to be let off the hook! The play screen is laid out clearly - you aim by positioning a target anywhere on the table (unlike some games that make you aim to the cushion), then you can choose the regulars like spin and shot power.</desc>

Then, you can play against other humans, your coach or try out the challenge mode that sets you up as a stowaway on a cruise liner, having to beat 14 opponents to be let off the hook! The play screen is laid out clearly - you aim by positioning a target anywhere on the table (unlike some games that make you aim to the cushion), then you can choose the regulars like spin and shot power.</desc>

Circus Lido, or Circus Ride, is an action game published by Uni Post exclusively for the PC Engine.

The goal of the game is to navigate the stage and defeat the enemies using the chameleon's two powers: his long tongue and his prehensile tail. The tongue can be used to capture enemies and spit them out towards the Venus flytraps, which are the only way to remove them from the stage. The tail can be used to climb vines scattered around, which allows the chameleon to ascend through the stage.</desc>

		<path>./Columns (Japan).7z</path>
		<name>Columns</name>
		<desc>Columns was one of the many Tetris-like puzzles that appeared after that game's great success in the late 1980s. It takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen "Columns"

While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.

If, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.

Occasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel Column appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.

The columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with Jewels.

Some ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. "Flash columns" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. "Doubles" allows two players work together in the same well. "Time trial" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.</desc>

		<desc>Columns was one of the many Tetris-like puzzles that appeared after that game's great success in the late 1980s. It takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen "Columns"

While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.

If, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.

Occasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel Column appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.

The columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with Jewels.

Some ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. "Flash columns" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. "Doubles" allows two players work together in the same well. "Time trial" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.</desc>

		<desc>Cyber Knight is a science fiction Super Famicom and PC Engine role-playing video game that combines the exploration of Star Trek with strategic robot combat. This game is intended for experienced role-playing gamers only. The random encounters are high even for a Japanese role-playing game with a mid-to-late 1992 Super Famicom release date (i.e., Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride) and the combat sequences (using melee attacks in addition to missiles and guns) are extremely slow.

The game was only released commercially in Japan.

In the 24th century, mankind has expanded into the reaches of outer space.[2] Meanwhile, the Earth had already disappeared as the center of human civilization. Each star system served as independent nation; war had occurred between these "countries" several times in the past. This led to a high demand for mercenaries to fight these wars for money. Some of these mercenaries went on to become space pirates due to their insatiable demand for wealth.

The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates. Suddenly, the battle takes a turn for the worse and the crew activate their jump drive without a destination.  They end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties. Even the captain was killed while en route to the mysterious destination. Only 26 of the crew survive, and only six of them are qualified for combat operations: the commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor. They are responsible for using the six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them after the fight with the space pirates. They discover a human colony that is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers".

The crew must fight back against the new alien threat and explore the galaxy in order to find a way to return to Earth.</desc>

They end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties. Even the captain was killed while en route to the mysterious destination. Only 26 of the crew survive, and only six of them are qualified for combat operations: the commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor. They are responsible for using the six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them after the fight with the space pirates. They discover a human colony that is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers".

The crew must fight back against the new alien threat and explore the galaxy in order to find a way to return to Earth.</desc>

		<desc>Cyber Knight is a science fiction Super Famicom and PC Engine role-playing video game that combines the exploration of Star Trek with strategic robot combat. This game is intended for experienced role-playing gamers only. The random encounters are high even for a Japanese role-playing game with a mid-to-late 1992 Super Famicom release date (i.e., Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride) and the combat sequences (using melee attacks in addition to missiles and guns) are extremely slow.

The game was only released commercially in Japan.

In the 24th century, mankind has expanded into the reaches of outer space.[2] Meanwhile, the Earth had already disappeared as the center of human civilization. Each star system served as independent nation; war had occurred between these "countries" several times in the past. This led to a high demand for mercenaries to fight these wars for money. Some of these mercenaries went on to become space pirates due to their insatiable demand for wealth.

		<desc>Daisenpū is a vertical shooter by Nec Interchannel and conversion of the arcade game of the same name (also known as Twin Hawk) originally released by Toaplan in 1989. In the year 193X, country R is overwhelmed by hostile enemy forces and the small oasis town 'S' is the main target of the attack. A handful of survivors escape to the jungle and start working on a counter attack - but they are soon discovered and are now running out of time, and they must launch the Daisenpū squadron before it is fully operational. The player takes control of a fighter plane and must fly deep into enemy territory, attack ground targets such as tanks, turrets and warships (the game curiously doesn't feature any flying enemies and no obstacles to fly into, beside enemy bullets). The plane starts equipped with a limited double-shot machine gun that can be slowly upgraded throughout the game by collecting power-pods left behind by small trucks. But the originality of Daisenpū lies elsewhere - the player can call a small squadron of six planes and have them fly in formation, shooting anything in sight and crashing into an enemy unit when defeated. The squadron can also commit a Kamikaze attack at anytime and destroy ground units, or combine to release a devastative bomb-attack. Finally, Daisenpū offers an unusual feature - levels do not pause between them and reveal instead a continuous flow of undisturbed shooting action.</desc>

		<name>Darius Plus</name>
		<desc>Amidst the clutter of arcade shooters in the late 1980s, companies needed to make their games stand out in some way. Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that "outer space" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.

Yes, fish.

Not even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.

The requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.

The arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.

Looking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.

Darius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.

When various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.

It was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, PC Engine, PC Engine (Super CD-ROM), Wii (Virtual Console), and ZX Spectrum.

The PC Engine saw three releases:  

Darius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published.

Darius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown).

Super Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen. Features new bosses, as well as a "boss rush" mode.</desc>

		<desc>Amidst the clutter of arcade shooters in the late 1980s, companies needed to make their games stand out in some way. Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that "outer space" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.

Yes, fish.

Not even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.

The requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.

The arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.

Looking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.

Darius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.

When various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.

It was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, PC Engine, PC Engine (Super CD-ROM), Wii (Virtual Console), and ZX Spectrum.

The PC Engine saw three releases:  

Darius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published.

The signal contains a message sent by Queen Melora, who pleads for the salvation of her planet from the invading forces of the evil alien Iva. TwinBee and his friends decides to set off to outer space to defeat the forces of Iva and save Planet Meru.[5] Detana!! marks the first appearance of TwinBee's and WinBee's respective pilots, Light and Pastel, who became prominent characters in many subsequent TwinBee video games and related media, although they were originally unnamed in this game (the characters were given their names in the audio drama TwinBee Paradise).</desc>

		<desc>Horizontal shoot 'em up for the PC Engine. The player, as cyber-diver Syd, must fly his hoverbike through the future city of Kabukicho to rescue his partner Deva from the corrupt police.

Overview
Download is a horizontal shoot 'em up set in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which the main character, Syd, is haunted by memories of his friend Ohala falling to a cybernetic menace. Meanwhile, he receives a call from his contact/partner Deva and must rush to her rescue when she is abducted by the Kabukicho police force. The game's story is depicted in a series of animated vignettes before each stage, similar to Ninja Gaiden. Beginning with the mean streets of Kabukicho, Syd will eventually jack into the internet and fights in a similar manner through cyberspace.

Download is perhaps best known for its profanity-laden game over messages. It was followed by a PC Engine CD sequel the following year: Download 2.

Gameplay
Syd's hoverbike has variable loadouts that the player can assign at the start of each level. These weapons can be upgraded further by finding power-ups within the level. The chief weapon, which can be fired infinitely, include a focused laser weapon and a scattered beam shot: the former is best for bosses and stronger foes, while the latter can quickly eliminate large crowds of weaker enemies. The player will often need to play each level a few times to determine the best loadout.

The player can also select between three sub-weapons: chaser missiles, which home in on foes; crusher, which absorbs shots and causes explosions; and barrier, which stops shots for a short time. Each sub-weapon has a finite number of uses which can be replenished by finding the right power-ups.</desc>

		<desc>A platformer where the player controls a small girl with an egg in her backpack, which can turn into a dragon.

Dragon Egg (sometimes styled Dragon Egg!) is a 2D side-scrolling platformer set in a fantasy world. The protagonist is a young girl who wields a dragon egg as a weapon. As she collects fire orbs, the dragon egg hatches into a baby dragon, and then subsequently grows further as more fire orbs are collected. As the dragon grows, the effective attack range of the protagonist increases, making the game easier. However, the dragon will revert by one stage if the player character dies.

The game also has a currency system and stores, which can provide additional fire orb power-ups and other useful tools, like health restoration and barriers, if the player acquires enough funds before entering.

The game was released exclusively for the PC Engine. However, as an action game, it doesn't include a lot of Japanese text and can be easily played by those not fluent with the language.</desc>

		<desc>The first game in Nichibutsu's Formula One top-down racing series.

F1 Circus is a top-down Formula 1 racing game and the first game in Nihon Bussan's F1 Circus series. It was first released on the PC Engine in 1990, but a modified version - also partially based on this game's sequel, F1 Circus '91 - would later be released on the Famicom in 1992. As with every other game in the series, the game was never localized in North America or Europe.

The game uses the real life names of drivers and teams from Formula 1, like Nigel Mansell and Ferrari. The series would continue to acquire the various licenses needed to use real names from Formula 1.</desc>

It was first released on the PC Engine in 1990, but a modified version - also partially based on this game's sequel, F1 Circus '91 - would later be released on the Famicom in 1992. As with every other game in the series, the game was never localized in North America or Europe.

The game uses the real life names of drivers and teams from Formula 1, like Nigel Mansell and Ferrari. The series would continue to acquire the various licenses needed to use real names from Formula 1.</desc>

Only the vehicles from the 1994 season are used. Michael Schumacher and Satoru Nakajima are the most popular racers in this video game, even though Nakajima is a hidden character.</desc>

Final Blaster is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up for the PC Engine. The player is part of squadron of fighters sent to save the world from an alien invasion. Final Blaster hosts a number of features that are distinct to the game: the first is a charge shot that resembles a phoenix and is the only form of projectile that can destroy certain larger enemies. The second is that the game configures its difficulty depending on how many power-ups the player has when finishing a level, or how often they've been destroyed.

The game was unique to the PC Engine and did not see an international release outside of Japan. It came out on the same day as W Ring: The Double Rings, another shoot 'em up exclusive to the Japanese PC Engine.</desc>

In fact, its play controls are among the most sophisticated in a PC Engine game and in general, in a tennis game (what still counts to this very day). Don't get fooled by its simple graphics. There is everything in this game that tennis is about. Smashes, stop balls, volleys, back and forehand spins or lobs. At the top of it all, you can play it in every thinkable player combination (training, tournament, 1-4 players). By the way: in addition, its one of the best multiplayer games ever.</desc>

In fact, its play controls are among the most sophisticated in a PC Engine game and in general, in a tennis game (what still counts to this very day). Don't get fooled by its simple graphics. There is everything in this game that tennis is about. Smashes, stop balls, volleys, back and forehand spins or lobs. At the top of it all, you can play it in every thinkable player combination (training, tournament, 1-4 players). By the way: in addition, its one of the best multiplayer games ever.</desc>

		<desc>On Earth in the 23rd century, a space time warp opens up over the Atlantic Ocean. From it comes an enormous invasion force analyzed to come from the 25th century. As Earth is attacked by the alien war machines, it is revealed that the culprits are identified as the Gader'el, a race of large bio-mechanic creatures, who have the ability to freely manipulate space and time; after conquering the future Earth in the 25th century, the Gader'el decided to ensure their influence on mankind by traveling back in time to the 23rd century, conquering that time and then going further into Earth's past.
As the armed forces of every country on Earth combats the Gader'el, each scientific academy collaborates on making a weapon capable of destroying the Gader'el's strongest weapons. The result is the Dryad, a single-fighter spaceship capable of wielding several types of futuristic weapons. The Dryad's flight path and mission is to warp into the Future Zone in order to reach the Gader'el headquarters and destroy their leader.</desc>

		<name>Gaia no Monshou</name>
		<desc>Gaia no Monshō (also known as the 'Crest of Gaia') is a fantasy round-based strategy game by NCS and conversion of a game originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in 1987. The Light and Dark forces are engaged in a fierce war and Böser, leader of the Dark Army, is now ready to capture the Rall Tower, source of the world's energy. Sieghart, leader of the Light army, is the only one who stands between the evil Böser and the complete decimation of the kingdom. Gaia no Monshō is a turn-based strategy game at heart - the player moves troops around a battlefield and attacks nearby enemy units. An Auto Battle mode is also available and gives the option to let the AI figure out of the player's next move. The game offers several play modes - the first one (Scenario Mode) gives the player the chance to jump straight into battle using predefined troops. The second (Construction Mode) allows him to build his own army using unit points. The last one (Campaign Mode) conveys story plot elements and starts in the siege town of Dirl, where king Sieghart battles the fierce Böser. This mode requires more complex strategy and the player must assemble his own troops using unit points and units lost in battle don't come back during the campaign. Unlike the other two modes, it offers a password system to save the player's progress through the game.</desc>

		<desc>Agedama Genji is a 4th grader boy in elementary school, and a hero on the training from 'Hero Planet.' Though the cheerful kid is no one special in appearance, he can transforms into a superhero called "Agedaman" by combining himself with his computer friend called Wapuro. He believes in Kiai power and he tries to handle all the problems that he encounters with that, so his father decided to let him go training on the earth accompanied by only Wapuro on summer vacation. After his arrival to Morisoba city, where an enormously wealthy clan rules arbitrarily, he joined East-Morisoba elementary school, then met a diva girl of the clan named Rei Kuki who has an ambition to conquer the world and, as a first step, attacks the city with a variety of chimera monsters that she and her grandfather create with the Monster-Cooker, which the rich old man invented. When they plot to attack the city she transforms into a super-villainess called "Onyomiko". The battles of Agedaman and Onyomiko began!</desc>

		<name>Gomola Speed</name>
		<desc>A game of reflexes and strategy inspired by the classic Arcade game Snake.

Gomola Speed is a top-down action game in which the player increases the size of their snake-like protagonist by collecting and uniting the various segments moving around the level. When long enough, the player character can wrap themselves around stunned enemies - the player can drop bombs that will momentarily stagger any enemy caught in the blast - and valuable food in order to acquire them. Once all the food has been collected, the exit opens somewhere in the level and the player can progress. Progressive stages have different gimmicks and solutions to completing them.

The game was developed by UPL and released exclusively to the PC Engine in Japan.</desc>

		<desc>The people of Gradius are in trouble. The ameoboid Bacterions have launched an all out attack against the planet, and it's up to you to fly into battle and save them. Along the way you'll be able to power up your ship with hyper speed, force fields, lasers, missiles, double beam cannons and more to help you battle.

Gradius is a side-scrolling shooter. Shooting certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your ship. Each level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating.</desc>

		<name>Hanii on the Road</name>
		<desc>Hanii on the Road (aka Hany on the Road or Honey on the Road) is a side scrolling action game by Face. After Hanii's exploits in Hanii in the Sky, the little Haniwa clay doll is back on a new mission. This time around, our cute friend must free the world from all the demons and other evil creatures that escaped from the Gods' realm. But this time around he's not flying or shooting balls of energy - instead, he must run along a roadway divided into four lanes, each moving at different speeds. And things are just not as easy as it may sound - Hanii has to jump over various enemies and try not to fall into deep holes dug into the ground, without forgetting the occasional change in scrolling direction and the myriad of other exciting, and often lethal, effects. A time limit also urges him to hurry and to quickly reach the end of each stage. Every little helps, and tiny wood signs scattered around every road tell Hany how far the next exit is. Additionally, special items can be collected along the way, such as Blue jars giving Hanii extra lives (twenty five of them need to be collected though), Mystery Jars giving from 100 to 1000 points, Extra Lives, Time Clocks, Rockets, Trampolines and other unique and often bizarre super powers (he can turn into a race-car or an almighty warrior in some stages!). Hanii on the Road consists of many levels and features a non-linear structure with interconnected paths to follow, as well as bosses. The game also offers a two simultaneous player mode where Lemon, a yellow version of Hanii, comes to the rescue.</desc>

		<desc>Hanii on the Road (aka Hany on the Road or Honey on the Road) is a side scrolling action game by Face. After Hanii's exploits in Hanii in the Sky, the little Haniwa clay doll is back on a new mission. This time around, our cute friend must free the world from all the demons and other evil creatures that escaped from the Gods' realm. But this time around he's not flying or shooting balls of energy - instead, he must run along a roadway divided into four lanes, each moving at different speeds. And things are just not as easy as it may sound - Hanii has to jump over various enemies and try not to fall into deep holes dug into the ground, without forgetting the occasional change in scrolling direction and the myriad of other exciting, and often lethal, effects. A time limit also urges him to hurry and to quickly reach the end of each stage. Every little helps, and tiny wood signs scattered around every road tell Hany how far the next exit is. Additionally, special items can be collected along the way, such as Blue jars giving Hanii extra lives (twenty five of them need to be collected though), Mystery Jars giving from 100 to 1000 points, Extra Lives, Time Clocks, Rockets, Trampolines and other unique and often bizarre super powers (he can turn into a race-car or an almighty warrior in some stages!). Hanii on the Road consists of many levels and features a non-linear structure with interconnected paths to follow, as well as bosses. The game also offers a two simultaneous player mode where Lemon, a yellow version of Hanii, comes to the rescue.</desc>

		<name>Hatris</name>
		<desc>Remember Tetris? The way those cubes kept coming at you? That was tricky enough, but what if they were half a dozen different hats instead? Derbies, baseball caps, cowboy hats, wizard hats, top hats and crowns? Well, that's the whole idea behind Hatris. The hats keep coming at you two at a time. All you have to do is stack them up five at a time and - poof - they're history. It sounds perfectly simple. Until you get into it. Then you'll wish you had six heads instead of one. Because this is the latest game from Alexey Pajitnov, the designer of Tetris, and his partner Vladimir Pokhilko. And anyone who could turn geometry into a contact sport is a force to be reckoned with. And this time they really want you to use your head. If you don't, you'll look pretty strange with that pile of hats on it!</desc>

		<desc>Image Fight is an intense vertical shooter by Irem and is the conversion of their own arcade game released back in 1988. The player takes control of the OF-1, a powerful Orbit Fighter ship codenamed Daidalos on a mission to annihilate the Moon defense system which suddenly went out of control. The rather unique feature of Image Fight is the "simulation mode" (called 'Image Fight') that precedes the "real battle" (called 'Real Fight'). The game counts a grand total of eight zones - the first five are Combat Training Stages and happen in a virtual space where the player must at least achieve a whooping 90% destruction ratio. If successful, the Real Combat reveals itself and the player gets launched in outer space and fly through three more stages. Just like with any traditional shooter, the ship can be upgraded by collecting flying capsules. They come in two flavors - the first are colored pods (blue and red) which hang around the ship and either fire straight ahead or in the opposite direction the fighter is facing. Those pods can also be thrown at the enemies to inflict more damage. The other kind are various devices that attach at the front of the ship and greatly improve its fire power - they include Bubble lasers, Homing Lasers, V Lasers or the powerful Drill Laser. Sadly, only one can be collected at the same time and the only way to dispose of them is to get hit. Finally, the speed of the ship can be adjusted anytime during the game and the resulting blast of energy can even be used to damage enemy ships.</desc>

		<name>Kattobi! Takuhai Kun</name>
		<desc>A top-down driving game where the player must deliver various packages around town, upgrading their moped as they complete jobs. The game has a subversive sense of humour.

Kattobi! Takuhai-kun ("Fury! Delivery Boy") is a top-down action/driving game from Advance Communications Company and Tonkin House. The player is a delivery boy who must make a series of increasingly surreal deliveries across town, occasionally leaving the country and getting into trouble with drug trafficking. As the player complete jobs, they can use their earnings to buy better two-wheeled delivery vehicles, upgrading from a pedal bike to a moped to a state-of-the-art motorcycle. Destroying their vehicle (by losing a life) drops them back down to the regular pedal bike.

The game was released exclusively in Japan on the PC Engine. It is perhaps best known to western audiences for its appearance on an episode of the Japanese video game TV show GameCenter CX.</desc>

		<desc>An Arcade game released by Taito about a priestess named Sayo-chan who must rescue the gods of fortune from monsters.

KiKi KaiKai ("Mysterious Ghost World") is a scrolling action/shooter featuring the shrine maiden Sayo-chan as she fights a horde of youkai and oni in a quest to recover the Gods of Fortune. It is a precursor to the Pocky &amp; Rocky games for the Super Nintendo.

Sayo-chan/Pocky makes her way across various levels, changing directions occasionally, and using either a wand or scrolls to exorcise the unruly spirits she meets. She can only get hit once before dying, though some enemies will grab her instead to slow her down.</desc>

		<desc>You're an elite chopper jockey, ready to launch your Cobra against the coastal defenses of an evil superpower. They've got the numbers. You've got the might and the fight! You're Twin Cobra, the most awesome attack weapon in the skies!
Bank in low over the desert and start pounding. The enemy's all over you! Knock out swarms of attack copters while you avoid smoking sheets of ground fire! Blast battalions of tanks into smoking craters.
Then it's open ocean warfare! Machinegun a fiery trail through wave after wave of heavily armed gunboats. Bomb huge battleships and destroyers. Strafe gigantic armored carriers as they pour on the firepower.
The longer you live, the tougher you get. Your weapons fire faster and harder. But the hostiles keep coming! See how much you can make the ground grunts scream! It's your war now.

Kyuukyoku Tiger  is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up and is the sequel to Tiger-Heli which continues the tradition to include the word Tiger in the title of each game in the series. Subsequent Japan-only sequels would use the same title, which roughly translates as "Ultimate Tiger".

The helicopter comes equipped with a default forward-firing weapon that is able to hit both air and ground targets, as well as a finite supply of bombs which hit enemies in a wide radius for massive amounts of damage. The player can find power-ups by shooting down the relatively sturdy Chinook enemy choppers, which initially allow the player to upgrade their standard gun to include more shots, but will eventually allow them to pick up weapons that can fire in different patterns. These include a four-way shot that fires in the four cardinal directions and a spread shot that fires forwards and outwards in a cone. The player can also find additional bombs by destroying this type of enemy.

At the end of each stage, and occasionally partway through, is a boss. These take considerably more damage than regular enemies and can fire a lot more projectiles as well.</desc>

		<name>Legend of Hero Tonma</name>
		<desc>An Irem Arcade side-scrolling platformer, featuring the titular hero Tonma. His main weapon is a fireball that can be upgraded multiple times.

Legend of Hero Tonma is a 1989 Irem Arcade platformer, known for its difficulty, brightly colored graphics and its rarity in the US. The game was converted to the TurboGrafx-16 in 1993 (based on the 1991 PC Engine version) making it one of the last games to be released for the system in the US.

The game is graphically similar to Wonder Boy, but is also structured similarly to Ghouls n' Ghosts. The player must pass through areas filled with enemies, trying to survive long enough to upgrade their fireballs to the point where it becomes far easier to cope.

Legend of Hero Tonma is an action game that puts players in control of the magic-user Tonma, whose role – as was typical for game heroes of the day – is to travel to another world and save the princess. Fight your way through seven stages using Tonma’s jump ability and shot power. Collect power-ups and barriers to grow in strength and pummel your enemies. Bring that strength to the end of each stage to face off against and defeat the menacing bosses that aim to keep you from the princess.</desc>

		<desc>Ripple is a student of magic, and her teacher is a terrifying witch. Ripple is particularly afraid of her teacher right now, because she's just broken a promise she made to the witch: Ripple took a peek inside the forbidden book Sleeping Demons! No sooner had she opened the cover then out jumped six demons, all of which raced away! Unless she can catch all six demons and get them back inside the book, the witch will turn Ripple into a frog for breaking her promise! So Ripple sets off on her quest with her two Elf-Star friends, Topsy and Turvy. Good luck, Ripple!</desc>

		<desc>Maison Ikkoku (めぞん一刻?) is a graphical text-adventure game developed by Micro Cabin and published on multiple popular Japanese home computer systems towards the end of 1986. It was ported to the Famicom by Bothtec in 1988. Micro Cabin then ported the game one final time to the PC Engine in 1989. The game is based on the popular manga and anime series of the same name, Maison Ikkoku.

The story is a bitter-sweet comedic romance involving a group of madcap people who live in a boarding house in 1980s Tokyo. The story focuses primarily on the gradual developing relationships between Yusaku Godai, a poor student down on his luck, and Kyoko Otonashi, a young, recently-widowed boarding house manager.

In the game, you take the role of Godai performing various missions that deal with the storyline of Maison Ikkoku. You have to avoid Yotsuya's pranks, save money to throw a party, proclaim your love for Kyoko and other things. The action takes place all over Tokeizaka and not just the boarding house. Players can visit Soichiro's grave, Chachamaru, the train station and many other familiar locales.</desc>

		<desc>AKA: 魔境伝説. The jungles surrounding the village of Minofu are under the thumb of the evil Jagu cult who require a blood sacrifice. A beautiful young woman named Flare has been selected as this season’s offering, however her boyfriend Gogan will not stand for it. Equipped with the legendary axe ‘Sting’, he braves the six zones of Jagu’s territory to defeat the cult and save his love.

Throughout the zones are breakable Jagu idols which drop various sized gems for points leading to extra lives, health revitalizing orbs of differing strength, crown-like crystal containers, and wing icons. Four crystal containers can be earned which charge the destructive power of Sting’s strike, while up to two wings can be collected increasing the speed of subsequent strikes.

Each time you use the axe, the power meter drains completely then recharges as long as you don’t continue to swing. The added strategy of - is it better to dodge and charge the axe for a crushing blow, or is it better to hack away as fast as possible – sets this game apart from most other hack-n-slashers. When you die, one level of speed and axe power is taken away and you must re-find an icon to get it back. The game doesn’t lock you to only scrolling right, so there are times where you can backtrack to find items.

		<name>Makyou Densetsu</name>
		<desc>AKA: 魔境伝説. The jungles surrounding the village of Minofu are under the thumb of the evil Jagu cult who require a blood sacrifice. A beautiful young woman named Flare has been selected as this season’s offering, however her boyfriend Gogan will not stand for it. Equipped with the legendary axe ‘Sting’, he braves the six zones of Jagu’s territory to defeat the cult and save his love.

Throughout the zones are breakable Jagu idols which drop various sized gems for points leading to extra lives, health revitalizing orbs of differing strength, crown-like crystal containers, and wing icons. Four crystal containers can be earned which charge the destructive power of Sting’s strike, while up to two wings can be collected increasing the speed of subsequent strikes.

Each time you use the axe, the power meter drains completely then recharges as long as you don’t continue to swing. The added strategy of - is it better to dodge and charge the axe for a crushing blow, or is it better to hack away as fast as possible – sets this game apart from most other hack-n-slashers. When you die, one level of speed and axe power is taken away and you must re-find an icon to get it back. The game doesn’t lock you to only scrolling right, so there are times where you can backtrack to find items.

		<name>Metal Stoker</name>
		<desc>A cyberpunk multi-directional shoot 'em up for the PC Engine.

Metal Stoker is a top-down, multi-directional shoot 'em up for the PC Engine, developed and published by Face (possibly through their subsidiary brand Sankindo). The game features the subtitle "Neo Hardboiled Shooting".

The goal of the game is to explore each stage, fight a boss and move onto the next. Some stages are comprised of several linear enclosed areas that require that the player clear the room of enemies before they can proceed, while others are more open and let the player scroll in multiple directions while seeking out their foes. The story is sparse, and concerns the player's testing out of a new Custom CS-05 tank through a series of simulations.

The game was released exclusively for the PC Engine. It has yet to be rereleased in any capacity.</desc>

		<desc>A sequel to Hudson's RPG featuring Momotarou: the Peach Boy of Japanese folklore. The oni are cooking up another scheme and it's up to Momotarou and his companions to travel the world and stop them.

Momotarou Densetsu II ("Peachboy Legend II") is an RPG for the PC Engine of the standard turn-based Dragon Quest mold. It is the second proper game in Hudson's Momotarou Densetsu series - which would later spawn the Momotarou Dentetsu series of railroad virtual board games - and features numerous other figures from Japanese mythology.

The general structure of the game has Momotarou cross the world with his animal NPC companions, solving the problems of each new town or village he comes across. Upon successfully resolving their demon problem, the town thanks him with elaborate celebrations. Momotarou can eventually pick up a large number of allies, who all follow behind him on the world map. Rather than force the player to locate each new location, they can send their animal companions to scout ahead to eliminate the amount of wandering around.</desc>

Momotarou Densetsu Turbo ("Peach Boy Legend Turbo") is the second game in the Momotarou Densetsu franchise, though is effectively a revamp of the first game released for the Famicom. The game displays Momotarou's origins as a baby born of a giant peach that a kindly couple found floating down a river, and covers how he met his animal companions and fought the Oni on their island.

The game sets up the sequel, Momotarou Densetsu II, which was released exclusively for the PC Engine a few months later.</desc>

		<desc>A platformer starring Hudson Soft's take on the famous Momotaro of Japanese folklore. The same concept would later be seen in the Momotaro Thunderbolt games for Game Boy.

Momotaro Katsugeki ("Momotaro Action Movie") is a side-scrolling action-platformer from Hudson that uses their Momotaro character who is better known as the star of the Momotaro Dentetsu and Momotaro Densetsu series. It is a PC Engine exclusive and never saw international releases.

Momotaro Katsugeki seems influenced by and plays similarly to Westone's Wonder Boy in Monster Land and the sequels that followed: the goal is to move across a set of 2D stages, and the player can talk to NPCs for hints and to purchase better equipment with the money they find. There is also a world map that links the various stages together.

The concept of a 2D side-scrolling action game featuring Momotaro would be further explored by Hudson with the two Game Boy Momotaro Dengeki/Thunderbolt games.</desc>

		<desc>Moto Roader is a futuristic racing game that allows up to five players to compete against each other. Players use the cash earned when they win a race to power up their machine. Not only can they change the "tire" and "body" of their vehicles, but they also can add "special" parts. Jump over tall obstacles with a "hopper" and blast past rivals at incredible speeds with "nitro." What multiplayer game would be complete without attack items? Use a forward-launching "grenade" or a backward-dropping "bomber" to blow up and knock away rivals. Outmaneuver rivals in all eight heats to become the champion.</desc>

		<name>Operation Wolf</name>
		<desc>Being a one-man army is a difficult business - just ask that bloke Rambo. But you have taken on the hard task of mowing down whole platoons of enemy forces single handed, all to rescue hostages from a rather nasty concentration camp. Choosing from one of four stages, you have a first person view of the action and have to carefully aim your on-screen crosshair to take out the bad guys - but don't get too trigger happy, as there are many civilians and innocents who have chosen just this moment to go for a stroll in the middle of a raging firefight. You have limited ammunition, which can be replenished by shooting the spare clips lying around (which are also dropped from objects such as coconuts and birds), and also a small supply of extra powerful rockets which make short work of armoured vehicles or helicopters that have you in their sights. Occasionally you will see a pile of dynamite that serves as a smart bomb, and a nice energy drink which increases your health slightly - which is essential as it does not recover between levels.

		<desc>Konami's imaginative parody on the Gradius series. It plays just like Gradius, with the same power-up system, but features a far more bizarre and imaginative series of levels and characters.
This game was released in Japan for the PC Engine and is a port of the Arcade original with a couple of differences: it doesn't have the arcade Stages 5 and 8, but features a stage titled SPECIAL and a new introduction that features several strange-looking Japanese characters. This is in contrast to the arcade intro, which chronicles the Gradius legacy up until the time of release.</desc>

		<desc>Ever felt underpowered and lacking in omnipotence? Well now is your chance to live the dream in Populous, Bullfrog's seminal god game. Domination is the aim here - you control a community of cute little guys and must build a population greater than your computer controlled rival. Starting with a house or two, you are at first limited to raising and lowering the ground - the flatter the ground around a domicile, the more advanced it becomes, up to the level of a sturdy fort. But this is not the extent of your power. More houses mean more people, and more people means the higher your little arrow creeps along your power bar, opening up such furious skills to inflict on your opponent like floods, swamps and volcanoes that disrupt the landscape and any city planning therein. Once you feel you have sufficiently dominated the opposition (the display on the top right conveniently gives you a visual guide here) then you release armageddon - all followers gather together and duke it out until there is only one. Depending on your score, you then move forward any number of levels which include diverse scenery such as grasslands, desert, snow and volcanic rock.</desc>

		<desc>Ever felt underpowered and lacking in omnipotence? Well now is your chance to live the dream in Populous, Bullfrog's seminal god game. Domination is the aim here - you control a community of cute little guys and must build a population greater than your computer controlled rival. Starting with a house or two, you are at first limited to raising and lowering the ground - the flatter the ground around a domicile, the more advanced it becomes, up to the level of a sturdy fort. But this is not the extent of your power. More houses mean more people, and more people means the higher your little arrow creeps along your power bar, opening up such furious skills to inflict on your opponent like floods, swamps and volcanoes that disrupt the landscape and any city planning therein. Once you feel you have sufficiently dominated the opposition (the display on the top right conveniently gives you a visual guide here) then you release armageddon - all followers gather together and duke it out until there is only one. Depending on your score, you then move forward any number of levels which include diverse scenery such as grasslands, desert, snow and volcanic rock.</desc>

Move the coloured blocks around to match them up. Blocks can only be moved left or right, and can fall down but not move up. Some levels are fiendishly designed and need some careful thought, and all this is against a strict time limit.</desc>

		<desc>Shinobi. It's Japanese for stealth, the perfect description of a Master Ninja. And that's exactly what you are! Armed with throwing stars and finely-honed battle skills, you must defeat the Ring of Five. Fight your way past mercenaries and karate thugs. Take out the meanest martial artists and rescue hostages. But these dangers pale in comparison to your ultimate challenge: A fight to the death against five evil Ninja Assassins whose mastery of the deadly ancient arts may well surpass your own!</desc>

		<desc>Shiryō Sensen War of the Dead is a post apocalyptic and dark Role Playing/Action game by Victor Musical Industries. Due to a series of mysterious events, the town of Chany's Hill has been cut off from the rest of the world. People have suddenly gone missing and cannibalistic monsters now roam the land, killing all who cross their path. The protagonist of the game is Laila Arufon, the youngest female member of the S-SWAT (Supernatural and Special Weapon Attack Team). She was born in the small town and has developped strange psychic abilities. Her Psychic Seal ("PS") and Mind Force ("MF") powers allow her to increase any weapon destruction power but also to increase her defense capability greatly. Her mission is twofold - she must investigate the mysterious and supernatural incident in Chaneys Hill and to rescue all the remaining survivors she can find and lead them to the town's church. Laila comes equipped with a combat knife and a Hand Gun (SIG/SAUER P226) - additional weapons appear later in the game including the Assault Rifle (STYER AUG), Grenade launcher (HK MZP1), Flamethrower (M2A1-7), Bazooka (M72A2) and so forth. Although most of the game uses a traditional top-down view, battles quickly drop the game into side-scrolling action phases. There, Laila fights hordes of monsters to gain experience (blue orbs), life (reb orbs), MF points (green orbs) or ammunitions (pink cases). She can also escape at anytime as long as she can reach the edge of the fighting area. The combat items are complemented by more conventional inventory items such as medic packs, psychic pills, keys and so forth. Player's progression is saved through a long password system.</desc>

You're a member of the elite Debuggers, a group of warriors who are jacks-of- all-trades. Assigned to inspect an unmanned space station, you have exactly 100 minutes to get in, destroy the monsters lurking in each block, make your way to the lowest level and deactivate the automatic detonator placed there. With each monster that slips by you, the core block becomes harder to survive in, so speed is key in preserving the facility and each separate block. Experience the thrill of survival as the timer ticks away and you uncover the truth of the events that occurred.</desc>

You're a member of the elite Debuggers, a group of warriors who are jacks-of- all-trades. Assigned to inspect an unmanned space station, you have exactly 100 minutes to get in, destroy the monsters lurking in each block, make your way to the lowest level and deactivate the automatic detonator placed there. With each monster that slips by you, the core block becomes harder to survive in, so speed is key in preserving the facility and each separate block. Experience the thrill of survival as the timer ticks away and you uncover the truth of the events that occurred.</desc>

		<name>Son Son II</name>
		<desc>This platformer sequel to Son Son was only released on the PC Engine in Japan.

Son Son 2 is the direct sequel to Son Son and features an interpretation of the Son Goku character from ancient Chinese novel Journey to the West. Unlike the first game, which played like a ground-based scrolling shoot-'em-up with several floors the character could switch between, Son Son II plays much more like a traditional platformer, specifically Wonder Boy and even more overtly Capcom's earlier arcade game Black Tiger. Son Son attacks with his extendable staff (based on Sun Wukong's Ruyi Jingu Bang weapon) and can defeat enemies to earn coins, which can be spent on upgrades and health refills. The player also needs to find a key on each stage before they can reach the boss.

The goal of the game is to rescue the other members of his party: Xuanzang (Tripitaka), Pigsy and Sandy. They are kidnapped during the opening cutscene by the final boss, who is depicted as a mysterious silhouette.

Son Son II is also one of the earliest Capcom games to use Zenny, their trademark fictional currency.</desc>

		<name>Stratego</name>
		<desc>A video game adaptation of the famous strategic board game. Find the opponent's flag, and watch out for that spy.

Overview:
Stratego is a board game adaptation that was originally published by Accolade for various home computers in 1990. The game was also localized for a Japanese audience with the PC Engine release, which was published by Victor Entertainment in 1992.

The game closely follows the rules of the classic Stratego board game as conceived by creators Jumbo, which was later licensed by Milton Bradley for North America. The game also offers various different modes, including a campaign mode which involves consecutive maps, as well as the option to change the visual design for the board and the pieces.

Gameplay:
The standard rules of Stratego are as follows-
The player must start the game by placing all forty units in the four rows on their side of the board.
The player can move any of the numbered units or the Spy (S) unit one space. The Flag (F) and Bombs (B) cannot be moved.
No two units can occupy the same space. If an enemy unit and a player's unit meet, the one with the highest number (which correlates to a lower rank) is removed. The winning unit then moves into the empty space. If they have the same number, both are removed.
If a unit touches the enemy's flag, they win the game.
There are special rules governing a few of the units:

The Spy unit will be removed if attacked by anyone. However, they are the only unit that can defeat the highest ranked unit - the Marshall, or #1. They can only do so if they are the attacker, not the defender.
If any unit touches a Bomb, they are removed from the board. The Bomb does not move into the empty space.
The Miner (#8) is the only unit that can destroy a Bomb.
The Scout (#9) can move any number of spaces horizontally and vertically.</desc>

You can even create your own team of super players and take them through league competition to become the international champs.

		<desc>Tatsujin is a vertical shooter by Taito and conversion of Toaplan arcade game originally released in 1988. The evil Gidans are about to invade the Borogo system, their armada of giant asteroids are approaching and they have to be stopped. The player must infiltrate and destroy no less than five large enemy facilities and take down swarms of alien ships and all kind of ground units. The space fighter comes equipped with a default Vulcan gun (Power shots) and two more weapons are available for the taking - the blue lock-on lasers (Thunder Laser) and green blasts of energy (Tatsujin Beam). The only way to increase the active weapon's firepower is to collect Power Boosters special flying pods leave behind. Although five boosters are necessary to trigger a power-up upgrade and boost up the strength of the current weapon, special red flashing power icons bring it up to maximum power in no time. Each weapon can be powered up to three times for maximum collateral damage and smart bombs in the shape of monstrous skull-faced energy blasts can be unleashed to kill most enemies on screen. Finally, speed boosters are strategically placed throughout the game to help the player dodge enemy fire more efficiently.</desc>

		<desc>Tatsu no Ko fighter (also known as Dragon Fighter) is a simple platform game published by Tonkin House. It follows the adventures of a young farmer as he travels across a country full of dangers. He carries around a long stick which he slyly uses to take down his enemies. He has a few more tricks up his sleeves - thanks to his magic book (press 'Run' and select a weapon by pressing 'up' and 'down'), he can also shoot blasts of energy from it. However, this technique depletes some of his magic energy which he has to refill periodically. But his ultimate weapon is the ability to turn into a powerful topless fighter - this technique is however only available for the toughest boss encounters located at the end of each area. In this form, our hero can use a powerful chain-whip (which consumes magic energy) to land more punishing blows than his bare fists. Throughout the game, various enemies drop magic orbs when defeated which range from power-ups (red P), increase max-life (green P), increase magic bar (green M), freeze time clocks, bombs, life potions and so forth. Each defeated enemy also drop money that can later be used to purchase life and magic from town people located at the end of each area. This is also where the stick can be later upgraded into a more lethal spear. Finally, infinite continues are available.</desc>

		<desc>Sinistron, released as Violent Soldier in Japan, is a side-scrolling, ship based shooter that was released for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1991.

The game is notable, among other things, for the adjustable armored jaws of the player's spacecraft. Opening the invincible jaws of the ship increases the spread of the player's shots but exposes the vulnerable cockpit. Obtaining one weapon upgrade allows the ship's jaws to be set half-way open (a 3-shot spread) or closed (with increased damage), and a second upgrade allows them to be closed, half open, or fully open (a 5 shot spread).

Five power-ups exist in the game. The Vulcan flame cannon, crystal-pulse laser, and CHAOS (homing) missiles are weapon upgrades. There are also speed upgrades and plasma droids, invincible pods which will flank the ship. The plasma droids can absorb enemy pellets and will even damage enemies they come into contact with.

The ship's charge-up attack releases a circular wave of force that will damage all enemies in a radius around the ship.

Sinistron has six stages of quickly increasing difficulty. The last two stages take place inside the Sinistron creature itself. The stages are:

Mechanical Stage
Gas Tunnel Stage
Biological Stage
Deep Space Stage
Organs Stage
Cerebral Cortex Stage</desc>

		<desc>Sinistron, released as Violent Soldier in Japan, is a side-scrolling, ship based shooter that was released for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1991.

The game is notable, among other things, for the adjustable armored jaws of the player's spacecraft. Opening the invincible jaws of the ship increases the spread of the player's shots but exposes the vulnerable cockpit. Obtaining one weapon upgrade allows the ship's jaws to be set half-way open (a 3-shot spread) or closed (with increased damage), and a second upgrade allows them to be closed, half open, or fully open (a 5 shot spread).

Five power-ups exist in the game. The Vulcan flame cannon, crystal-pulse laser, and CHAOS (homing) missiles are weapon upgrades. There are also speed upgrades and plasma droids, invincible pods which will flank the ship. The plasma droids can absorb enemy pellets and will even damage enemies they come into contact with.

The ship's charge-up attack releases a circular wave of force that will damage all enemies in a radius around the ship.

Sinistron has six stages of quickly increasing difficulty. The last two stages take place inside the Sinistron creature itself. The stages are:

Mechanical Stage
Gas Tunnel Stage
Biological Stage
Deep Space Stage
Organs Stage
Cerebral Cortex Stage</desc>

		<desc>The third game in Taito's QIX series, Volfied loses the geometric abstraction of previous games in favor of a more sci-fi look.

Overview:
Volfied is an Arcade title released by Taito in 1989 as the sequel to QIX II. As well as ports for the PC Engine, Genesis and the home computers Atari ST, Amiga and PC, Volfied was also released on the 2005 PS2 compilation Taito Legends and as a Java mobile game in Europe in 2007.

On home consoles in North America, it was marketed under the more familiar QIX brand. It was known as The Jintori ~Volfied 1500 (Japan) and Neo QIX (US) for its PlayStation port, which was part of the Simple budget series. For its North American Sega Genesis release, it was known as Ultimate QIX.

Gameplay:
As with QIX, the goal is to carve out pieces of the playing field by drawing a box that encapsulates a certain percentage of the screen. While drawing these boxes, the player's vehicle is vulnerable to the various enemy craft patrolling the playing field. Areas within the drawn squares turn inert and are inaccessible by enemies. Once the player turns enough of the playing field inert, which is a minimum of 80% for Volfied (up from the 70% needed for QIX), the level is complete and the player earns a bonus based on how far over the minimum percentage amount they managed to achieve. Each screen has one large enemy that cannot be defeated: if the player cuts the field in half with one maneuver, the "active" playing field will be whichever side holds the large enemy. Smaller enemies, however, will be destroyed if they are inside the inert area.

Volfied introduces small bonus pods that, once enveloped in a box, confer bonuses and power-ups to the player. The type of power-up they earn is based on the letter on the power-up.</desc>

		<desc>A golf sim from Data East for the PC Engine. It later received a rerelease on the Wii Shop in Japan.

Winning Shot is a golf game for the PC Engine/Turbogfrafx-16 and was the very first game based on the sport to be released for the system. Up to four human players can play, though because of the nature of golf, each player takes alternating turns depending on their distance from the hole. The game has many similar features to golf games of this era - the player can select which club to use, whether or not to hit the ball at a slight angle to adjust its trajectory and which direction to hit the ball towards, before hitting the requisite power gauge at the right point to send the ball flying as close to the hole as possible.</desc>

		<name>Wonder Momo</name>
		<desc>An action game presented as "hero show" developed by Namco.

Overview:
Wonder Momo is an action game starring a girl named Momo. The game is actually a tokusatsu "hero show", I.E. a stage show with people in costume acting as heroes and villains; such tokusatsu shows were once a popular form of entertainment for children in Japan and generally would feature well-known heroes and villains, such as characters from Kamen Rider. However, based on the appearance of the audience, the "Wonder Momo" show seems to be aimed at a slightly different audience. It is being presented at "Namco Theater".

In the game's storyline, Momo is a heroine from space who is fighting the evil "Phantom Warudemon Army" (Kaijin Gundan Warudemon" / 怪人軍団ワルデモン).

Gameplay:
The player controls Momo with a traditional 8 way joystick or D-pad, in the case of the home ports. Momo can jump and attack with the respective buttons; she can also high jump by holding up and jump and has several attacks at her disposal. Each stage consists of a backdrop against which Momo will fight a variety of enemies; If the player wanders far enough to either the left of right, they will encounter a curtain. After enough enemies are defeated a boss will appear. A whirlwind will also appear at various points; if Momo makes contact with the tornado, she will turn in to Wonder Momo!</desc>

		<desc>The player controls a boy named Tarosuke, who travels through "Jigoku" (the Japanese concept of Hell) fighting off "yokai" (mythical Japanese monsters) on his way to his final fate, as determined by Buddha. He destroys his enemies by firing small Ki bullets, which can be charged to increase their power; however, if overcharged, he is left unable to move or fight for a few seconds. During boss battles, Tarosuke kneels at a shrine to Buddha and prays, summoning "Monmotaro" (not to be confused with "Momotarō"), a spirit which floats in the air and drops energy balls on the boss and any lackeys he has. Once the boss is defeated, Tarosuke goes to the next stage.

Like Clovis from Dragon Buster, Taira no Kagekiyo from Genpei Tōma Den, and Momo Chan from Wonder Momo, Tarosuke has a life bar (labeled as "POWER") but only one life; if the meter is empty, the game is over (unless he has a certain item). There are no scoring systems present, but the game utilizes currency (only referred to as "MONEY") which is used to buy items, among other things.

There are five stages: Jigoku Iriguchi (Gateway to Hell), Kugyou no Michi (Path of Penance), Yuukai (Ghost Sea), Sabaki no Tani (Valley of Judgment) and Rinnekai (Land of Transmigration). There are multiple paths which can be taken in many stages, which may influence which of the five endings the player gets. One of the paths leads the player to a fairly racy dance hall show, after which he is given a box. If he opens the box, he might get 10,000 in money, or might be turned into an old man until he buys a particular item in a shop (this is based on the tale of Urashima Tarō). There are five different endings depending on what Tarosuke did in the game:

    He goes to Hell.
    He goes to Hungry Ghoul World.
    He goes to Beast World.
    He returns to Human World.
    He goes to Heaven.</desc>

		<name>Battle Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>Once an ancient arcade game, and with a previous version on the PC Engine by Pack In Video, Hudson Soft have taken the addictive gameplay of Lode Runner and given the graphics a complete face lift. The puzzle-based action in Lode Runner is simple: You are presented with a side-view platforms-and-ladders based level and you have to collect all the gold and escape without getting caught by the baddies. To defend yourself, you can dig holes in the ground, either to the left or to the right, and enemies stumbling upon them will fall down and be trapped. If you time it right, the hole will re-fill before the enemy can climb out, forcing them to respawn elsewhere in the level. If you prefer evasive action, make sure the coast is clear so you can escape up a ladder or across a well-placed rope, but be warned - they will follow! Once you have collected all the gold, hotfoot it to the nearest long ladder and escape out the top of the screen. In magazine previews, this was originally titled Lode Runner II.</desc>

		<name>After Burner II</name>
		<desc>One of Sega's big arcade hits using their 'super scaler' technology, it was a bold move to try and convert this to any home machine. After Burner II is, quite simply, one of the most mindless shooters that you're ever likely to play: simply fly your F-14 into the screen, dodging missiles like crazy and letting all hell loose with your vulcan cannon. There is precious little strategy - even less than Space Harrier, and often luck plays more of a part than skill. The action is split up by the occasional bonus stage - a run through a canyon blowing up anything that dares to exist in front of you. Fuelling planes and landing strips also make a regular appearance.</desc>
