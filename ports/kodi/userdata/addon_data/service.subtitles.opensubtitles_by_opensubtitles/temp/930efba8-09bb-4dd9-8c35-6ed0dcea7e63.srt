2
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,182
- What's happening?
- Go.

3
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,309
Mom! Who are they?

4
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,687
I don't have time to explain it
to you now. You have to go.

5
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,688
Quick!

6
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,110
Mom will come after you.

7
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,113
Go. You have to go.

8
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,741
Anybody here?

9
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,749
Would you mind?

10
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,958
For sure.

11
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,494
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.

12
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,496
- Did you have any problems?
- No.

13
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,706
Hold it.

14
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,627
Hello.

15
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,009
Out!

16
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,262
Get out!

17
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,511
I might have you all skinned alive
once all of this is done.

18
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,048
Quick!

19
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,080
Shoot! Shoot!

20
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:58,760
Duck down!

21
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,758
Shoot them!

22
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,764
Alert the patrol boat.

23
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,433
I want them stopped.

24
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:38,960
What's this?

25
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,295
Smells good.

26
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,546
Get out!

27
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:43,715
Of course...

28
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:45,592
as soon as you give us the bar.

29
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,344
Give it up, Lara.

30
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,971
- I will not ask you again.
- You went too far Milenko.

31
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:51,765
Bringing these animals
into my house.

32
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,768
- Give it to us or we'll find it!
- Go to hell!

33
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:55,727
Get out.

34
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:56,811
Out!

35
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,367
Look at this fool...

36
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:27,384
I'll show you.

37
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,720
Just don't hurt him.
He knows nothing about it.

38
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,348
That's my girl.

39
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,149
Anybody here?

40
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,006
Drop it, please.

41
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:44,594
Get that rascal, he's got my gold!

42
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:31,307
Calm down, calm down!
I will help you.

43
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:32,392
Come with me!

44
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,436
No! I'm not a Nazi!

45
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,105
Just calm down... Come on.

46
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,274
I'm your friend.

47
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:40,608
Will you trust me?

48
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:42,777
Would you come with me?

49
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,031
Come on. Come with me.
Let's go.

50
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,494
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.

51
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,747
- Did you have any problems?
- No.

52
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:08,970
Come.

53
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:44,741
Keep looking.

54
00:39:58,523 --> 00:40:01,109
They are here to help us, Mr. Kurjak.

55
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:15,832
Twenty pieces.

56
00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:35,967
Let's go, guys!

57
00:45:33,274 --> 00:45:34,275
What's that?

58
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:38,154
Do you know that this can buy
your shitty dump a hundred times?

59
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:39,572
So what?

60
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:42,033
What am I going to do with that?
I need cash!

61
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:48,707
Like this...

62
00:50:15,473 --> 00:50:17,434
Here, this is what they gave me.

63
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:19,269
Have you ever seen them before?

64
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:21,730
Them? Never.
Just some punks...

65
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:23,356
Those are their plates.

66
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:27,318
What you did is very patriotic.

67
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:32,615
A very unusual and valuable item.

68
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,326
Where's it from?

69
00:50:38,913 --> 00:50:40,373
I found it.

70
00:50:43,793 --> 00:50:46,171
From now on, I'll only speak to you...

71
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:53,803
Now you'll tell me everything.

72
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:45,528
Is that her?

73
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:49,574
She won't get far.

74
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:53,953
Stay with him!

75
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:49,851
Keep going.

76
01:19:22,053 --> 01:19:23,471
Gear up!

77
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,950
Throw the explosives.

78
01:22:33,578 --> 01:22:34,746
Lower, lower!

79
01:27:57,736 --> 01:27:58,361
Straight ahead!

80
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:12,584
Give it to me.

81
01:28:13,305 --> 01:28:19,726
